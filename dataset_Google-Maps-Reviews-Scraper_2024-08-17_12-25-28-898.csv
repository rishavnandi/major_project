"0","Cleanliness is upto date , but canteen food is really disgusting. There's no specific diet for a patient, same food is being provided to all which is very unprofessional. For example, A Kidney failure patient who's restricted to green leafy vegetables is provided spinach in lunch that too in huge amount. There are no such experienced doctors for treatment. Rarely you can find 3-5 only.","Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar","1898",,,"4.6","3",
"1","I had an incredibly disappointing experience at this hospital. The staff were unprofessional and unresponsive, leaving me waiting for hours without any updates or assistance. The facilities were poorly maintained and unhygienic, making me question the overall standards of care. The doctors appeared disinterested and rushed through consultations, providing minimal information and showing a lack of empathy. Overall, the service was subpar and left me feeling frustrated and neglected. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone seeking quality medical care.","Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar","1898",,,"4.6","1",

"4","My experience at this hospital was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I arrived, it was clear that patient care was severely lacking. The reception staff were rude and unhelpful, making me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patient in need. The waiting area was dirty, with stained chairs and a foul smell lingering in the air.

After an excruciatingly long wait, I was finally seen by a doctor who seemed completely disinterested in my condition. The consultation was rushed, and the doctor showed no empathy or concern, barely glancing at my medical history before prescribing medication without any explanation. The nurses were equally indifferent, providing minimal assistance and often ignoring my requests for help.

The facilities were appalling – outdated, unclean, and clearly not maintained to any acceptable standard. I even saw insects crawling in the corners of the room. The overall hygiene was so poor that I was genuinely worried about the risk of infection.

Communication was practically non-existent, with no one bothering to explain my treatment plan or what to expect next. It felt like I was left to fend for myself in a place that should prioritize care and support. This hospital is a disgrace, and I would strongly advise anyone to seek medical attention elsewhere. It's unsafe, unsanitary, and utterly lacking in compassion.","Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar","1898",,,"4.6","1",

Overall, the in patient service is world class and full 5 rating. But they gave me a non deluxe room saying that it is deluxe though some deluxe facilities like freeze, microwave and kettle are available. Only for this not so good practice, 1 rating reduced. Otherwise it is 5 out of 5. Not to forget, the Doctors are also very good. I thank from my bottom of my heart to all the doctos, nursing staff, patient care attendant and maintenance staff for their patient centric approach.

"2","Hospital is one of the best multi-speciality in odisha. Doctor Soumen Roy and his team were the best we could have asked for.
Nurse Narmada and Soumya were too kind and nice throughout the stay and took care of my father in their best capabilities. Kudos to them for standing by their oath and taking best care of patients. Wish them all the best and great future ahead!

Cons- Management is not as great as the Doctors and staff. Too expensive on pocket. Pharmacy within hospital does not let u get discounts. They should focus on cleaning the patient area and rooms more often instead of once a day.","Apollo Hospitals","17373",,,"4.7","4",
"2","Very good and renowned multi specialty hospital. The staffs and doctors are very nice. There should be more chairs available for sitting.

They give you to option book from their Apollo 24x7 app and let you choose your preferred timing for opd consultation. But that's just a marketing gimmick.

Even if you book an appointment, when you reach at hospital first you have to pay consultation fees and collect your receipt, then you have to go for BP, HEIGHT AND WEIGHT check.

After that you have to submit your receipt at doctor's cabin attendant. Then as per their current serial of receipts submitted you will be allowed to see the doctor.

I ask what's the point of making an online appointment booking.","Apollo Hospitals","17373",,,"4.7","4",

"1","Very disappointed with the staff members behaviour. They are rude and arrogant. You visit a pvt medical with higher expenses for better quality and facilities but it was a very regretful experience for me. At the entry the reception members were unprofessional and the self service kiosk was also not working. Waited for the endoscopy for around 3 hours and the end when the report came the doctor was not available for the day. They intentionally register the waiting number towards the end so that we have to visit the next day for an appointment. The doctors are okay but the overall experience was very bad. Not recommended. Better to go IGKC for gastro and kidney or any better govt hospital.","Apollo Hospitals","17373",,,"4.7","2",

I'm suffering from peripheral neuropathy so visited this hospital.

The doctor advised for MRI on the first visit. MRI cost is nearly 10000 rupees in this hospital.
The lady in the reception insisted on giving 5 star rating   in the first visit. She even wanted to help me by taking my phone and giving 5 star rating herself on my behalf.
Another lady insist on taking your prescription for you to the in house medicine store where you won't get any discount.
Visited this hospital twice. Since didn't get any relief from the pain by the medicine so stopped going there. Of course didn't fall in to the trap of doing MRI.

Visited a professor of neurology from SCB medical Cuttack and got recovered in two months just by medicine without MRI.

"2","Exceptional Care and Expertise: A Stellar Experience with Dr.Satyabrata Dash ENT - Sunshine Hospitals Bhubaneswar

Review:

We had the privilege of receiving exceptional care from Dr. Satyabrata Dash with our recent visit for Sinusitis Problem, and we are writing this review to express our gratitude and recommend his services to anyone in need of an ENT specialist. Sincere thanks to my brother Raju who introduced us to doctor for the first time and at that very moment we were impressed by his professionalism and dedication to patient well-being.

His deep understanding of the complexities of the ear, nose, and throat, combined with their extensive knowledge of advanced treatment options, made us feel confident that we were in the best hands possible. That made us prepared for Sinus Surgery even though we were scared but the way the treatment was explained, is commendable. The whole process went very smooth

From the initial consultation to the final follow-up, doctor took time to listen attentively to our concerns and provide thorough explanations for each step of the treatment plan.
`
Additionally, the entire staff at Sunshine Hospitals was welcoming, courteous, and efficient.The office environment was clean, modern, and well-equipped, further enhancing the overall experience.

Post surgery the condition is significantly improved and will still continue.

Thank you, doctor for your outstanding care and unwavering commitment to your patients.

Sincerely,
[Paul and Ambalika]

They have Wards made in Under-construction Area , where they have just put White wash in The Rooms And no other facility other than a Bed n a Chair.  The Maintenance of The place is Zero and Housekeeping Staffs Are Absent...  They Treated my patient as if They Dumped Her Some Where near Trash.

Good doctors are available but the authority need to focus more on personal hygiene and cleanliness inside the premises.

Other departments too need adequate manpower to provide smooth services.
The dresses of the staff members, of all categories, should be neat and clean. The waiting area is also not adequate.

The HK staffs are always trying to keep the inside premises neat and clean by keeping in mind that cleanliness is next to godliness.

"1","My father was alone when he suffered a Cardiac emergency and was brought to Utkal by his colleagues.While I am grateful to Dr Sushant Pradhan and his team for the patient management I would like to share my feedback.I requested Operations for a feedback form meant for the patient NOK but they gave me one meant for the patient instead hence  this platform.
I am a Paediatrician from Pune.
My father was admitted on 3.06.24 and discharged on 10.06.24.
My observations are as follows
1.ICU
a) No designated waiting area/shelter for the patient NOK.
b)There is no  protocol in place for counseling even though there is a counseling room. ICUs that I am aware of usually have twice a day briefing at a particular time either the consultant or duty doctor updating patient's attendant of the condition/management.Here in Utkal they take your number and tell you to wait for them to call.You are called with just ""DAKICHANTI"" you run upstairs anxiously only to be told we have ordered coconut water for the patient please wait for the caterer and pay that's it.Seriously!!!
After waiting for hours 2nd day onwards for ""the call""
I had to approach Operations to meet the doctor and only then came to know of the treating physician being on leave and someone else being the stand in!
c) You are asked to enter ICU bare feet yet saw members of the staff come and go multiple times with shoes on.How hard is it to provide shoe covers or in slippers for a few visitors??
d) During visiting hours one evening witnessed the duty doctor chatting up on handsfree while perusing/writing in the patient case files for a good 10 minutes.Quite audible to me in patient cubicle.It sure wasn't an unavoidable call nor was it discussing any case as I could hear most of it.Not just lack of  civic sense but poor work ethics specially infront of visitors  in ICU/HDU unit.
e) My father was shifted to the ward before discharge after a stay in HDU yet he had an ECG (LA) lead stuck on him till we reached home.Even the central line was removed moments before stepping out of the hospital.They knew of the discharge well in advance yet neither was he explained of his medications nor this central line thing sorted.One nurse midway of explaining medicines calls someone else and asks her to remove the line.Totally chaotic.There weren't many patients so what kept them busy no idea.
2.DOCTORS
I have interacted with 2
Dr Sushant Pradhan: Excellent doctor would highly recommend.
Dr Sanat kumar Sahoo : Epitome of ZERO SOFT SKILLS. Surely AVOID.
3.NURSING
Some of them were outrightly rude.
On efficiency I have already described above.
4.SECURITY STAFF
Extremely Rude almost rowdy especially the person infront of ICU upstairs.He keeps sitting scrolling on you tube shorts even when spoken to.You can  go upstairs only after being cleared by two security people downstairs so why this rowdy behaviour?The whole experience was weird.
4.CANTEEN
UNHYGIENIC
None of the staff had gloves on while actually handling food .They have gloves on only when taking the food trays around for delivery.
The set up is basically a DHABA catering to patients as well as visitors.
5.BILLING AND MANAGEMENT
Polite and helpful staff,provided us with the necessary information and attended to all our queries patiently.Procedure was Swift .
People in Operations were attentive and efficient.
Lastly I would like to say please make more efforts to provide patients and attendants with basic civic courtesies.  Medical faculty both the Doctors and Nurses should explain things properly.""Potassium correction going on"" or ""ventilator re atchi "" should not be allowed as ""update ""
There is no Dietician visit or advice on discharge summary.Just  low fat high fibre diet.
Its a pay for service set up so no one deserves to run around clueless.
Bigger infrastructure and newer equipments aren't going to take you far as every other hospital is offering the same these days.
World class service not in my opinion.
I do hope management takes cognizance of the feedback and looks into the shortcomings.
Thank you","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3380",,,"4.4","2",

Last time visited utkal hospital for treatment of my grandmother, they have some Nuro problem
I do ticket for Nuro dr Dr Amitav Rath. For rs 800.00 as we hope he is is very nice doctor, but such a bad experience we had face with the way of he treat. I really disappointed with the treatment at 1st we wait for a long for appointment then his co staff suggest us to MRI without doctors concern then he came after lunch and prescribed a nominal medicine.. which has no cured capacity… behave such like a idiotic way … I feel really shame on me coz my grandmother came from kendrapara .. and waste her full day but no outcome…. Why they make fool to the innocent crowd…..Wrost doctor I never seen befor Dr Amitav …….","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3380",,,"4.4","1",
"2","Shame Shame Shame!!!
If anybody want to lose your dear ones it's a best place,hell literally. In hell atleast they won't ask money.

My father in law went for edoscopy for complaining about less appetite .Doctors said he has low BP so can not do endoscopy. What you folks will do in this case,will admit to ICU??? Seriously?
He was in not that condition to get admitted to ICU.when he went by himself how can you Doctors say its critical because of low BP and make him to admit in ICU.in a day 70k bill only for medicine,in others section thousands of bill, charged for airbed which never been given which we came to know when took him in ambulance back home when Doctors surrendered. In low BP anybody think its a wise step to take inside ICU. Its totally scam.management and Doctors are doing scam to get money.medicine field became scam field now.ppl lost humanity,and Doctors neither qualified nor have nobility anymore.Stop considering Doctors as God, they are doing only duty for money which is also not proper.let me mention the doc name Manabhanjan Jena.In span of 2 days we lost our father.

I will do a consumer court case against this.
Be aware folks
Be safe from these hospital.","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3380",,,"4.4","1",

"10","My experience at SUM  Hospital was horrendous from start to finish.

Services and Management:
The management was disorganized and indifferent, taking hours to admit our patient  with poor communication and excessive paperwork.

Nursing Staff:
The nurses were rude and unprofessional, often ignoring requests and responding with irritation.

Doctors' Behavior and Attitude:
The doctors were dismissive and arrogant, barely listening to our  concerns and rushing through consultations.

Treatment:
The treatment was careless and substandard.The hospital seemed more interested in charging exorbitant fees than providing proper care.

Ward Conditions:
The ward was filthy, noisy, and chaotic. The bathrooms were rarely cleaned, and the beds were uncomfortable and poorly maintained.

Money Over Care:
The hospital prioritized profit over patient care, with hidden costs and unnecessary procedures at every turn.

Dangerous Discharge Practices:
Our patient  was discharged in poor condition, leading to severe health complications. This reckless practice endangers lives.

Summary:
Incompetent management, rude staff, poor treatment, filthy wards, and a focus on profit over care make SUM Hospital a nightmare.","SUM Hospital","1197",,,"3.7","1",

"7","My personal experience from 2005 to today .

I have been visiting to this hospital since 2005 , when ever me or my friends or my family members got sick.

It's the best private medical colleges cum hospital in odisha.

That time hardly 500 patients were visiting. If you go tomorrow you can find 5000 patients at a time or more than that.

It's management continuously increased wide range of health care services.

Best departments are :-
1- Cardiology
2- Cheast & TB
3- General Medicine & Surgery
4- Neurology
5- Endocrinology
6-Hematology
7- Skin & VD
8- COVID care
9- Gastroenterology
10- Urology

Need Improvement:-
1- Nephrology ( kiddny transplant)
2- Gynecology
3- Opthalmology
3- Over all ambience & cleanness.
4- bed availablity
5- canteen meals
6- Dental care
7- Test reports are taking one day time .

As it's a medical colleges it will give a feeling like government hospital but it's quite reasonable for common people.
OPD registration is free. Medicine cost is minimal. But nurses needs to be more caring.

It has dedicated COVID care centre  & blood bank. All clinical tests are cheaper in comparison to others. Parking facility is available.

Dental care is separated from main building.

Overall my experience on this hospital is excellent.","SUM Hospital","1197",,,"3.7","5",

My mother has problem of gall stones in gall bladder and in CBD i,e common bile duct. 1st the stones were melted through the process --due to they were very small size (1 to 2mm)--of ERCP in gastroenterology dept. & Dr.jimmy sir is very cordial and helping nature. Then we got discharged from the hospital after 3 to 4 days and was prescribed to revisit the hospital again for the gall stones surgery. Now we have come and dr. Senapati sir is very calm and composed guy Outta no where. My mother was undergone with laparoscopic surgery then stones got removed. Overall doctors and ward Didi's are very good, security guards are also doing their job heartly as well sweepers are also very good and doing their duty respectfully. But their is one negative about this is sewerage system, toilets 🚽 are pathetic, in floor 1 surgery ward their is only one toilet in which male and female get into. Urine and stools are also scattered allwheres🤭 This is actually a concern of infections and multiproblems. hence, this is a request to the owner sahab to place a myriad toilets separately for male and females.
After all a great thank you to all....🙏","SUM Hospital","1197",,,"3.7","4",

Once u start processing for discharge they don't listen unless you show them the final discharge papers. I was admitted in the hospital n they intentionally delayed the paper n submitted the insurance company at 7 pm where as they knew day before the discharge date. Then the insurance was approved n mail came to our mail but due to some unknown reason the hospital didn't get the mail so we forwarded the mail n showed everything but still they kept on delaying till 11.pm. I asked for my medication after food but they didn't give that also as they were waiting for the discharge papers n bill .seriously recommend everyone to avoid this place u can get so much better facilities in different hospitals I seriously came here due to the doctor now I am regretting it. Fortunately I stay in bbsr so getting discharged so late is not an issue but think of the people who come from outside bbsr how difficult is it for them. I think there main motive is to intentionally delay the procedure n charge for one more day.","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3380",,,"4.4","1",
"0","Title: Exemplary Care and Compassion: Dr. Dilip Kumar Kar at Utkal Hospital, he is the best doctor.

Review:

I am compelled to share my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Dilip Kumar Kar at Utkal Hospital's Oncology Department. Dr. Kar's expertise, coupled with his profound compassion, has been instrumental in guiding me through one of the most challenging times of my life with unwavering support and hope.

From my very first consultation with Dr. Kar, I was struck by his warmth and genuine concern. He took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and patiently answered all my questions, alleviating many of the fears that accompany a cancer diagnosis. His ability to communicate complex medical information in a manner that was easily understandable was truly remarkable, empowering me to actively participate in my treatment decisions.

Throughout my treatment journey, Dr. Kar demonstrated an unparalleled level of dedication and professionalism. He meticulously tailored my treatment plan to suit my individual needs, leaving no stone unturned in his pursuit of the best possible outcome. His attention to detail and commitment to staying abreast of the latest advancements in oncology instilled confidence in me and my family, knowing that I was in the best possible hands.

What sets Dr. Kar apart, however, is his profound empathy and compassion. He not only treated my physical symptoms but also tended to my emotional well-being, offering words of encouragement and support when I needed them most. His reassuring presence provided solace during moments of uncertainty, reminding me that I was never alone in this journey.
Thanks to Dr. Dilip Kumar Kar sir and the exceptional team at Utkal Hospital, I am now on the path to recovery, filled with gratitude for the compassionate care I received. If you or your loved ones are in need of oncology services, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kar and Utkal Hospital without hesitation. Their commitment to excellence and unwavering compassion truly make them a beacon of hope in the fight against cancer.","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3380",,,"4.4","5",

"2","Very good behaviour of Doctor and nursing staffs  towards patients. All the patients are taken utmost care inside the wards also inside the OT and ICU, being treated within the required time and proper discharging process of patients after recovery is maintained.
Both my parents underwent proper treatment from Dr. Sushant Pradhan sir, Dr. Bijay Mishra sir, Dr. Madhusmita mam, Dr. Gourav Dash, and many more excellent and extremely qualified doctors.
Except for the security personnels, everything is pity fine there. One of the Security personnel Biswa Ranjan thinks himself as the owner of the hospital rather than being the security personnel he should be, making new rules at any particular situation according to him. No proper waiting hall is available for relatives of the patients admitted to OT and ICU. The security personnel send us downstairs and wait there. I explained them multiple times that doctor had advised me to wait outside, he might need several agreements in between the surgery. The doctor made a phone call to call me from downstairs. It is completely unsatisfactory situation where your parents are admitted, doctors might need your agreements and security personnel like Biswa Ranjan are pushing us downstairs. I really feel there is an urgent need of waiting hall outside OT and ICU.","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3380",,,"4.4","3",

Today we went for the follow up check for which a TPC lab test was required. So I did my lab test at the hospital and to cross check I also did the lab test at an well known outside pathology lab. The lab reports were too different. The TPC reports difference between the hospital and outside lab was around 30000 in which the hospital was lesser. Due to this difference I consulted the doctor but to my surprise he did not even look into the report and threw it. We had waited around 1.5 hrs for his visit. He said the lab reports of the hospital were only correct and others were not so clinically correct and also said that we did not believe him therefore we did the test outside. We only wanted to cross check the reports and we were not satisfied. You all can check other reviews related to the lab reports of this hospital are not so correct all the time, so I would suggest all to cross check the lab reports if you have a doubt.

You can see in the video how the room cleanness was. Not sure if they regularly check the rooms. The room 531 is not suitable for twin sharing.  The room is so congested that if one patient has to move then the other one also need to be moved. In an emergency it would be very difficult to vacate the room. The only good thing as I observed that one of the nursing supervisor Ms. Nibedita who was really taking care of patients and listened to the patients voice. I wish her a good luck. After the complain, Mr. Biswajit from House keeping team, who took the responsibility and guided the team to maintain the cleanness and hygiene. I wish him a good luck.","Apollo Hospitals","17373",,,"4.7","1",
"0","""I had an exceptional experience at Apollo Hospital! The facilities are top-notch, and the staff is incredibly friendly and professional. From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease and confident in the care I would receive.

The doctors and nurses were highly knowledgeable, empathetic, and took the time to explain everything thoroughly. They made sure I understood my treatment options and felt comfortable with the plan.

The hospital's attention to detail and commitment to patient satisfaction is impressive. I was treated with dignity and respect throughout my stay.

Apollo Hospital truly lives up to its reputation for excellence in healthcare. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking quality medical care. Thank you, Apollo Hospital, for taking such great care of me!""

So, a heartfelt thank you to The doctors and nursing staff for being excellent in their services. The treatment is good, as per the level of expectations. That’s why there is huge rush in apollo.

"1","One of the worst experience I had there in apollo bhubaneswar. Horrible experience.
I am explaining below in details.
1. My father got admitted on 13th July'2024 in emergency due to abdominal pain. Hospital administration kept him admitted for a week without proper diagnosis.  In the mean time billing amount was compounding  like rocket.  No postive response from anyone starting from Nurse to doctor. We admitted there for 7 days. Doctor do visit for 4 days only.  But in billing, they have charged us 12 consultation fees(Rs.1250 each) when I asked in billing section they told. Remaining billing was for their assistant visits) What rubbish!!!! Imagine if doctor's assistant will  only  visit your patient hospital will charge it like full  fee's of doctor itself. It shouldn't happen!!!
2. Whatever the disease will be initially they will  punch you with high price antibiotics and injections ( price of antibioctic and injections will be minimum Rs.5000) if you got admitted for a week, the price of medicine will  shoot up to 2 lakhs approx. &  you won't be able to know whether your patient have consumed these amount of medicines or not.( God knows). Then when you receive final bill. They will charge you additional 10% of medicine bill saying it medicine administation charge. I was surprised when I see this amount,  10% of total medicine bill. (Ex. If your medicine bill is 2lakhs, hospital will charge you 2.2 lakhs) saying it is protocol. ( non sense). 0% discount in medicine.  You will easily get these medicines in half price in normal market.
3. Hospital will provide you worst quality of food in entire bhubaneswar.  Even small nurshing homes are giving good quality of food. When you get your final bill  it will shows you around 10k for a week stay only in food. 10k separate for food services.  ( I was wondering what is food services- hospital says "" ap daily kya khaoge jo puchne ata hey- In simple language- waiter service) Imagine the type of loot there in apollo.
There are many more points I can highlight.
I can suggest if anyone planning to visit apollo bhubaneswar never ever think of it. You can see other options. If you think you have health insurance you will b free from any hassles then forget it. Your health insurance will not sanction the 100% of claim amount.  At the end money will be paid by you.

Thanks for reading
I hope you can understand my point.","Apollo Hospitals","17373",,,"4.7","1",

"1","If you have insurance or want to do treatment through cash(specifically in patient treatment) I would strongly suggest to avoid Sum hospital. Once the patient is admitted you will feel like as if your close ones are getting treated in a government hospital (rural area). No proper communication at all about the patient /treatment, as an attendant you need to follow up for even getting an update, for getting a test done, for getting the results and even to shift from ICU to normal ward or for discharge. Such a big hospital and with lot of fame but there is nothing systemic. Department doctors won't be visiting ICU on a regular basis and after escalation they used to visit ICU to treat a critical patient. I don't doubt the ability of any doctor, but I beleive this hospital is getting used for the PG students as a case study/pratical perspective. In fact heard from the security guards that it would be better to get treated at Sum ultimate if you can afford. Sum hospital is only good and reliable only for the BSKY card holders. This is a genuine review and I have personally experienced the same here.

Total Casualty charges for a small injury is 550 and surgical charges is 341. I will suggest the whole public of Bhubaneswar Don't visit Sparsh Hospital for small dressings. The actual fact 1 Rating is Pharmacy is forcing patients to purchase generic Medicines instead of TBact ointment, When I raised the Pharmacy they replied in Emergency we are providing these ointment, And one stupid lady over the Pharmacy counter arguing very badly, As a customer I don't have right for ethical medicine. How dare to provide generic ointment for my small kid, A small dressings cost is 891- Which is totally profit no cost included because staff prescribed me surgical item when I reached they used all old items and kept it for their own usage, At heart of Bhubaneswar How you people are cheating to educated mass and What is the situation of poor and uneducated people who are visiting this Hospital. You have got lisence not for only profit but also you have minimum mentality of service. Feeling shame. Date 8th December 2023 check your cctv 6PM - 6.20PM for details enquiry.

The doctors are great listeners and quick with solutions. The staff is caring and quick. I cannot recommend my consultant, Dr Monika Gupta enough. She is literally one of the best doctors I’ve had. She listens and understands your problem before providing a solution. I am so so glad that I delivered at AMRI, cause I couldn’t have been at a better place.","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","13546",,,"4.8","5",

My father is there from last 3 days and the reason is he is having severe stomach ache. Hospital wrote a lot of tests to do and said to do on the same day but it was done after 24 hrs. No one is available for an emergency. 3 day of medication and continues test but no change in health and only thing doctors say is wait it ll be fine . He is still having 10X pain just after the painkiller dose goes off and they are keeping him on painkillers from last 3 days","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","13546",,,"4.8","1",

This hospital provides Highly Standardized Services at a Highly Standardized Amount. Here, the doctors are highly cooperative and supportive as well. The Nursing Administration including the PCAs are attentive in providing best service before the patient. But requires to be Instant Action Taker without fail. The Security Administration Here, requires to be more patientful and should make reduction and relaxation as well in maintaining the very proper restraints/protocols, before the Patient and Attendant as well. Whether it is showing off the Attendant pass during security check or during visit to the IP Patient by the attendants, less in number. Heartfelt gratitudes to Medical Superintendent, Srimanayan Mishra, administrative officer, Rashmi Madam, C.O., Sushant Sahu sir, the following nursing sisters, Rashmita, Sushree, Priyanka, Jayashree, Swagatika and the Apollo Hospital Administration to make our patient recover.

"0","I had an emergency admission at Manipal hospital Bhubaneswar in recent past ,They had charged me near about Rupees 3 Lakhs for my fracture in my right hand ,though operation cost was  on higher side but Dr was good and operation was done smoothly.
But am very sorry to say certain things are not upto the mark as Irregular staff response and very casual in attending bed services by some of the nursing staff . which was very much impressive in case of earlier management(AMRI).As had seen  last year while my father was got admitted.
Secondly I didn't like in Manipal then previous Amri is after operation in my next first visit i,e my first visit/ consultation after operation around after 14 days as per discharge summary they had charged me doctor consultation of Rs.800/- and for stitch removal Rs.400/- which shouldn't be charged at least , after taking three lakhs for operation.Top Management should eye upon it.If these little things are not considered it might lost its reputation at Bhubaneswar.
Also I found there were some inexperienced staff in nursing dept during my stay  *while some of them are very good and polite in nature*,
Thirdly the third party engaged over their for providing patient uniform should be improvised during my stay I found dirty dresses twice though they had changed immediately after complaining and concerned dept in charge had assured to check the same and not to occur henceforth .
One dept which was good as before is housekeeping as most of the  old staffs are still continuing.
They have hiked all double & single room accommodation charges from last year by 10 to 15 percent .Above all it is costlier then other nearby reputed hospital at Bhubaneswar.I think it might be the effect of brand/management change.May take some more time to be at par with last AMRI management.

They denied me to give painkillers late at night

1.Train properly the front team reception/May I help you.They should explain properly about the room booking, estimated cost and rest procedures.They don't do what they committed.

Such a worst hospital I've ever seen. I went to this hospital on November 19th for the first time.
I was suffering from cough, sneezing, diarrhea and breathing difficulties. On the same day, they gave me a lot of pills and it cost around 800 ruppes. I went home. On the the very next day I become more tired. Next day I had my board exam.
I went to the hospital again. Both the times the security told me to go to the casualty first.
They gave me nebulization and I felt good and also gave me  injection of paracetamol through the cannula. They've taken blood samples for some blood test. And when I went for the billing, I got really shocked. It was around 4500 rupees. I told to cut some of the test which is not nessesary now and then then bill amount become 2850.
And sent me home. When I reached home, I started shivering. I don't know why... I went to the hospital again and they were telling that I am dengue positive. They told me to get admitted in the hospital. I told I'm from another state, I'm studying here and I've my exams from tomorrow. They literally made me panic and I booked flight to my home town.  Because I didn't have any other choice. When I reached my hometown i went to the hospital right away from the airport and it cost me only 600 rupees.
And the report was negative .
And the doctor told me there is dengue antibody present in my body antigen report is negative.. May be I was affected with dengue before. Which means a doctor can easily find that I am not dengue positive now. still I don't know why they give me a wrong report.
Because of that wrong report I lost one year of my degree and I lost around 15k including the flight ticket. Such an irresponsible hospital I've ever seen in my life!!","Sparsh Hospitals & Critical Care Pvt. Ltd.","1696",,,"4.2","1",

Dr. Rashmi Hegde, as my wife’s gynecologist, has been a pillar of support throughout her journey. Her expertise and compassionate approach made every consultation reassuring. She took the time to explain every detail, ensuring we were well-informed and comfortable with the treatment plan. Her timely availability and prompt responses to any concerns were truly commendable. Dr. Hegde's dedication to her patients' well-being is evident in the personalized care she provides, making her an exceptional doctor.

Dr. Ankita Bhagat, our pediatrician, has been equally remarkable. Her warm and friendly demeanor instantly puts children and parents at ease. She is thorough in her examinations and ensures that every aspect of our child's health is addressed. Her timely guidance and availability have been a great source of comfort, especially during emergencies. Dr. Bhagat's genuine care and commitment to her young patients' health and happiness make her an outstanding pediatrician.

The nursing staffs and the other staffs are quite  helpfull and very polite . Cleaning and sanitisation are always there . The private rooms are also well equipped but the attendant bed is quite small for a big person like me.
Food canteen is also good serving good food at a very reasonable price .

The hospital may be small and not-so-jazzy, but the patience and committement with which the Doctors and nurses work here is just unbelievable. Doctors visit thrice a day. Explaining patients with confidence and strong voice of instructions as well. Saw few nursing staffs working 16 hrs at a stretch. Still never ever grumbled or hesitated to attend patient's requests. We were being treated by Dr. Shovan Rath, Dr. Bhawani and few others who frequently visited and stood like a pillar of confidence and assurance by my side, while I was in ICU. Even their OPD manager Mr. Alok was also very cordial and cooperative. Mr. Panda of the insurance desk goes all out, to assist the patients for their claim related matters. I wondered, when did they take rest, because I kept seeing them every now and then.
I sincerely wish them all success and shall remain grateful for bringing me out of the conditions of Covid.","Health Village Hospital","651",,,"4.5","5",

Before to this we were into different level of treatments, but result was only sadness to our life.
As when we meet the doctors in Health Village there we got the positive thought & vision. Treatment started from the Thairoid  cause, Let me say this was our main problem. Doctors gave us good mentoring and support. We took 22-23 days of treatment cycle and then after we continued the medicines & physical exercises for 3 plus months.
By all the blessing and care, we are happy ….we are blessed with baby boy …on 7th Jan 2022.
Our sincere thanks to Dr. Smita Sarangi Mam for their good mentoring and support… A Great experience and Blessing ….…

This is V.Uttam Kumar aged 27 who suffered with Severe Covid Pneumonia. To start with, Initially I took home isolation for 10 days, but I don't see any kind of improvement in terms of my health. Finally my family has decided to move me to Bhubaneswar for the medical treatment. But we faced lot of issues to get ICU bed, however we managed to get the ICU bed in ""Health Village hospital"" which is the best hospital I ever seen. I battled my life in ICU with Covid around 28 days but I got one of the best treatment to recover from Covid Pneumonia. After one month i discharged from hospital with no amount of risk. And I am doing absolutely fine now though had a little requirement of oxygen. I sincerely thank to each and every member of Health Village staff for the service you have provided during 1 month treatment. Heartful thanks to all the Doctors and Sisters in the hospital who has given me one of the finest treatment to make me alive again. Special thanks to Dr Shovan sir & Dr Bhabani sir. Without your help and hopes given during my treatment, I wouldn't have alive today with the way I suffered with Covid. Needless to say you have given me an another life with all your efforts. Me and my family Indeed greatful to Health Village team forever. I will recommend to all my friends, relatives and family to visit this best hospital whenever they need any kind of support. Once again a big thanks to each and every member of Health Village team. Kudoss and salute to all of you.. 🙏🙏🙏

Thanks & Regards,

Improvements :-
Upon complaining the staff acted really fast. Nursing staff and specially her supervisor (4th floor) - Aarti Sahoo was really kind hearted and addressed our issue patiently. Nurses were also sweet and well spoken (4th floor).
Some staffs have really behaved like family.
Regularly visiting the hospital since 3 years, but now the discharge was a lot faster than it used to be.
Overall process was smooth.

Things that can be improved :-
Cost is high. Should be little less for all sort of people to afford.
Room charges are also too high.
Ambulance service and drivers should be trained to handle patients well.
Patient's food should be cooked well. Chapati are half cooked sometimes.
..

A lot of changes are taking place and really hoping for more positives in future.","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","13546",,,"4.8","5",

"5","Initially I was not willing to write the but if I don't raise my voice then this hospital will continue to fool people irrespective of the background.

1- Treatment - Nephrology Department is pathetic, please avoid it. They gave 100% wrong report and wrong diagnosis and they said the process cannot be done here (I have written report) and the same process I could do it in another hospital.

2- I was admitted for biopsy - they charged money for dietician consultation. No dietician visited me neither gave any consideration. Upon asking they say it's mandatory charges.

3- If they cannot do the process, they why they admitted me and took money?

4- I was admitted in a semi private room - 3200 per day but they charged 18% GST which is against government rules.

5- Wrong Billing - They bill many items under your name and charge money. If you ask they just delay the billing and make you wait for hours like 3-4 or may be more.

6- If you are an attendant, your life is hell. They make you run from one corner to another. No proper communication.

7- Staff do not have empathy: I heard anything IP coordinator saying - yeh patient railway ru refer heichi, aite toh free re milila aau kete free re nebbo - it means he was referred by railways and he is getting free treatment for many things, how much more he wants? This is the attitude.

8- You will find tobacco all over the washrooms and places.

9- Their priority is money, not patient health and conditions.

All the points I said, I have proof and I can prove in the court also, don't think that this is a fake review. I sincerely request that please avoid this Highly unprofessional and vasooli hospital for treatment. I am writing this review to make people aware of all the illegal activities done in this hospital on the name of service. Don't waste time in this hospital, please select good hospital for correct treatment at correct time.

"3","Very bad experience in the hospital at the time of my Grand father’s treatment  and he admitted in the Hospital for 7 days. On the day of discharge we waited for 6-7 hours and the fact is we were cash deposit patient . The billing process is very pathetic, we waited at least 6 hours for the final bill.

As he was a aged and serious patient they also forgot to give his prescribed injections and Antibiotics on time. After I complained the nurse came to give the injections .
And after discharge , i have a small doubt in the prescription and nebulisation process as they did not described  and advised me  how to take the medicines and nebulisation. They have a emergency contact number in the discharge summary but they didn’t respond and didn’t clear my small doubt regarding medicine taking time.
Very pathetic experience.
Zero star experience after paying this much huge amount and that also for a cash patient.","SUM Ultimate Medicare - Best Multispeciality Hospital in Bhubaneswar","6992",,,"4.7","1",

The insurance provided 20,000/- approval prior admission. After admission, there was a query send by insurance to hospital, regarding which I was completely unknown. There was no any counselling, no information from hospital insurance team. As a result I have to pay 1,13000 at tha time of discharge. And my approval was cancelled. This is completely for negligence of staff. Also I pay 1 day extra bed charge due to negligence of ward secretary. Madam advice discharge at 11am but my file was not ready till 3:30 pm. Is this the way to work. Apart from this all the services was very nice,. But think if someone admitted in insurance, but at the end time she/he had to pay 113000, how disgusting is this. Never want to visit here also never recommended any one. Poor counselling . And I am harrased completely after this mentally . Being a person in medical department, if I was treated like this and go through this condition then what about common people. I must say many people suffer like me .

Gave the samples and some reports need more than 3 to 4 days so we asked them is there any facilities to avail the reports via email or what's app. They gave us a number and said to es these facilities are provided here. And today on the report receiving day they said that we don't provide report in that way. You need to come and collect it. Also the phone number they gave us is useless. Not connecting everytime. I don't know it's a hospital ir a garbage of so called humans. Please anyone don't dgo there for your treatment they only there to torture patients and looted their money.

3. Very much inexperience doctors who doesn’t know which procedure to operate first. Lack of co-ordination among them.

"5","I had an appointment scheduled for 10 AM online, but upon arrival, I was informed that doctors would not be available until 12 PM. At 12 PM, I was asked to undergo a test, which I promptly did, returning with the report by 1 PM. Since I needed to consult with two doctors, the nursing staff advised me to see the second doctor first. However, by the time I reached the second doctor, he had gone for a one-hour break. When he returned, he told me to consult with the first doctor first.

Despite waiting for another hour, the first doctor, aware that a 72-year-old senior citizen had been waiting since 10 AM, chose to have lunch and returned only at 2 PM. She then took a 40-minute lunch break. By 2:40 PM, we had decided that enough was enough. Throughout this entire time, no one offered us even a cup of water.

I strongly suggest changing the hospital's name from ""CARE HOSPITAL"" to ""WE DON'T CARE HOSPITAL.""

After expressing our frustration, the doctor quickly finished her meal and addressed us. However, she was neither humble nor accepting of the fact that she had made us wait for so long. Instead, she argued with us, questioning if she wasn't allowed to eat. She addressed us for merely 1-2 minutes before we went to see the other doctor, who made us wait another 45 minutes before addressing us in just about 20 seconds. By the time we were done, it was almost 4 PM, and this 72-year-old senior citizen with neuro and ortho issues hadn't eaten anything all day.

The staff seemed clueless about the consultation process, and the appointment system is highly inefficient. If a doctor is scheduled for OT in the morning, why are appointments being offered at 10 AM? Indicate that the doctor will be available at 12 PM or 1 PM, or not at all for that day.

I can assist you in changing your hospital's name from ""CARE HOSPITAL"" to ""WE DON'T CARE HOSPITAL.""","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","5023",,,"4.3","1",

"6","I am extremely disappointed with the care and service at Shree Hospital. One of our patients was recently admitted to the ICU, and the experience has been nothing short of distressing. The staff’s behavior was appalling and unprofessional; they often treated our people with complete disregard, behaving more like indifferent hospital nurses than compassionate caregivers.

Furthermore, Shree Hospital lacks transparency in its dealings with patients and their families. Important information was either withheld or inadequately communicated, causing unnecessary confusion and stress.

Given this experience, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Shree Hospital to anyone. We will actively advise others against choosing this facility for their medical needs.","Shree Hospitals","645",,,"3.6","1",
"4","The worst, unprofessional hospital I have ever experienced .Orthopedic doctor behaviour is very rough and rude. The hospital management and doctors are very unprofessional. This is a money oriented hospital not for treatment .We wasted our precious time and money with these Joker's.

Also no transperency with logistics, intension was very clear to loot money. Wasted our 3 month's of time. Verity of Joker's are sitting there to harass the patient and attendant.

Don't waste your  valuable time and money with this hospital better to prefer other hospitals for better service and peace.

Government of odisha and IMA need take strong and strict action against such hospital's and Doctors.","Shree Hospitals","645",,,"3.6","1",

The pharmacy didn't give the bill and I had to followup 5 times to get the same.

The rates are overrated compared to the horrible service they provide. Please avoid this hospital at any cost.","Shree Hospitals","645",,,"3.6","1",
"6","Reception staffs and some nursing staffs behaviour are very poor(particularly ladies staffs). They didn’t even know how to behave, and how to reply to a patient’s family members.

They’re coming to you because thay are trusting your hospital. Otherwise they will never come back to you and never give recommendations to anyone for your hospital .","Shree Hospitals","645",,,"3.6","1",

Despite seeking urgent care  in the emergency ward, I was redirected to the OPD without assessment, only to be sent back to the emergency ward and eventually advised to seek care elsewhere. Lack of proper evaluation and dismissive attitude marred the experience . The doctors didn't act right and were not polite.

They schedule appointments 15 days in advance, confirm the time the day before, but upon arrival, we were informed that numbers are allocated based on billing on the same day.

Then I called them on the same day of appointment, they are telling that Dr. is on leave and not coming from last 3 days, then I told them then you should inform me that before. There answer was only sorry.

Then I took another date of appointment.

Don't ever go to this Hospital, Management is very worst. They book appointment through phone. Then they will give ticket number after billing. But they will call you 3 hours before. And you have to wait more 3 hours to consult with doctor. I came here to meet Dr. Ravi Sankar. When I asked that why you called me so early, management answered that Dr. advised to call patient 3 hours before. So if you want to consult doctor of Shree Hospital then you have to give 6 to 8 in Hospital.

All they care about bill how much bill they have to generate before test they are concerned about how much bill they should prepare they don't ask for what diagnosis to run but the bill to generate. You can understand the mindset of people and the most terrifying thing is this kind of mentality in health care .

The doctors and nurses are very cooperative and friendly..even other staffs like Mr Sunil from billing department really helped me a lot for the cashless claim process, literally I had to sign in few forms and he filled all other details .. the total bill was around 47k only whereas in Apollo for the same surgery it was whooping 2L !

Coming to the rooms it was well maintained, clean even better than Apollo.

Maybe hospital services were not good in the past but my experience was really good.. I would to thank my doctor Dr Bulu nahak , because of him the surgery went smooth!🙏

Only con is CT scan is not available in the hospital, you need to visit some other lab for the same ,however despite the rush in the lab there doctor helped to expedite the scanning process..wish it was in-house but the staff politely explained addition of those will cost 5L+ per month which is not profitable for them which I understand completely..I liked their honesty in this matter 🙂

I suggest hospital to improve below things-
Provide handwash,towel and geyser in washroom.
Need to provide a more wider bed for attendant.

Overall thank you all staffs!

The hospital has got very qualified doctors and technicians. It is very clean and has got comfortable waiting areas.

I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional knee replacement treatment and care I received under your dedicated team's expertise. From the initial consultation to the post-operative recovery, every step of the process was marked by professionalism, compassion, and outstanding medical care.

The orthopedic surgeons Dr Sandeep Singh and their support staff demonstrated an unparalleled level of skill and commitment. Their thorough explanations, attentiveness to my concerns, and the successful execution of the knee replacement surgery.

The nursing staff's unwavering support during my Mom’s recovery played a crucial role in making the rehabilitation process smooth and comfortable. Their patience, empathy, and tireless efforts did not go unnoticed, and I am truly grateful for their exceptional care.

Additionally, the hospital's facilities were conducive to a positive healing environment. The cleanliness, organization, and efficiency of the entire team contributed to an experience that exceeded my expectations.

Please convey my sincere thanks to everyone involved in my Mom’s knee replacement journey. Your commitment to excellence in healthcare has not only restored my mobility but has also left an indelible mark of gratitude on my heart.

Thank you for the outstanding services provided by your hospital, and I will be sure to recommend your institution to others seeking top-notch orthopedic care.

It was really a painless experience for wisdom tooth removal and Root Canal Treatment.  I didn't experienced any minor pain post removal too, thanks to the technique and medicines recommended by Doctors. The treatments are very well planned and doctors are available for support even post treatments for any doubt or concern. An added benefit is that the doctors are quirky and you will not be bored during the exhausting and long dental treatment.","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","5023",,,"4.3","5",

Staring from staff to Doctor all are well cooperative and you will definitely find best assistance and treatment as well. This
is one of the cleanest hospital as well.
Best Doctors are available for assistance and the best treatment is ensured.

When I do my regular Health check up frequently….recently I did the package optima check up it was carried out smoothly from entry to exit.

Mr.Kedar who co ordinates the check up from entry to exit is one of the best person I have ever seen . I thank him and appreciate him the way he executes his job . Just an excellent human being and sincere employee . An Organisation needs this type of employee and human being.

However My complain goes to Dr. Smita satapathy( gynic) who behaved so rudely . She misbehaved to me and my wife while a optima health check up was carried out ( PAP smear) . I did not even went back to her after the reports were received and consulted another Doctor outside. She thinks everyone comes to care is from small village. I would like to clear in this platform that I am a NRI …more qualified then her in my field and holding a top notch position in a 5 billion dollar organisation . If she can behave like this to me and my wife I wonder how she is behaving with other patients and treating them.
I request to the management to talk to her to treat and talk to the patients politely.  The way he behaved with my wife I was even thinking to lodge a complain against her in IMC( Indian medical council). One spoil tomato can spoil the whole basket … Hence management should take action.

Hope I shall get a response on this.
Rest I really appreciate and love they way they care at CARE.

I got admitted here only because of doctor and insurance company’s preference.

But the biggest shock came when they refused to give me water when I requested for some. And to top that the nurse Gitanjali misbehaved with me.

N i bought every medicine . I had no symptoms of  such a high thyroid value. So i cross checked the data in apollo and then in Amri .As expected the value has changed this time to the normal range(luckily in both the case) . Thank god i never started the previous medication which was prescribed as per the wrong report. It was really disappointing when you realise that a complete day at hospital n all those medicines are of no value . I cant explain the stress caused to me and my family members due to that single wrong report . I asked them to cross check it . They said its the machine not us who is to be blamed .

From the moment I arrived, the staff at Hospital immediately made me feel comfortable and confident in their abilities. The medical team was incredibly knowledgeable, dedicated, and compassionate. They took the time to explain every step of my treatment plan, ensuring that I was well informed and involved in my own care.

The nurses and support staff demonstrated immense kindness and empathy throughout my stay. They always treated me with respect and made sure I was as comfortable as possible. Their diligence in monitoring my vital signs, administering medications, and providing timely assistance truly made a difference in my recovery process.

The facilities at Hospital were clean, well-maintained, and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. This, coupled with the hospital's adherence to strict hygiene protocols, made me feel secure and confident in the care I was receiving.

Furthermore, I would like to commend the hospital staff for their impeccable organizational skills. Despite the high number of patients, they managed to maintain a smooth and efficient workflow, minimizing waiting times and ensuring that each patient received prompt attention.

Overall, my experience at Hospital was beyond satisfactory.

Suppose you go with a patient as attendant here they don't allow you with attendant to go consultant room /opd to talk with doctor. Here most of doctor and staff are talk with in hind and English. If some one. Don't know that language he can struggle to understand doctors advice. This is main and  untold true realty of AIIMS Bhubaneswar. And no doctor give there official mobile number for emergency contact.
And some security behave like a nonsense to attendant or other family member of a patient.

IF THIS REVIEW READ BY ADMINSTRATIVE OF AIIMS KINDLY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. THIS IS AN HUMBLE REQUEST FROM SO MANEY PEOPLE.

I went for sun burn rashes which comes particularly in summer then disappear. As I got it last year & then this year too in approaching summer.
He particularly said this line
""this can't be treated""
& For another one he said ""go to somewhere else not here"".
He asked nothing how it came , no history.. nothing just saw for 1second then said this.
& My diagnosis completed.

Public goes there expecting to be treated by expert professionals & this is what they do.

"5","Its right that it provides free treatment but at what cost? At the end of the day it is the duty of the doctors to provide their knowledgeable service with precision and provide answers. I was scratched by a cat and went to the hospital withon 24 hrs. It was evening time and all the doctors were unavailable so i consulted the doc in the emergency ward where he wrote me a  dose of tt and rabies vaccine. When i went to the nurse for injection she gave me an attitude ( still manageable) and said she shall give the tt the same dat and rabies vaccine shall be given the day after( I wasn't told rabies vaccine should be given within. 24 hrs they misguided me right there.  As i had an exam the day after I couldn't take the rabies vaccine but took the tetanus. I repeat I wasn't told neither by the doctors nor by the nurse that i should have taken the vaccine within 24 hrs. As i came back from my exam i checked with Internet about rabies and got to know the vaccine shall be given in 24 hrs. I next day ie the third day of my cat scratch i rushed to hospital . I visited the female opd. It was even more interesting. There was lady doctor middle aged sitting . I describe her the facts which she was least interested in . She was more interested in making people nervous and give her valuable personal opinion about the patient ( me ) she didn't even see my wound and started. Writing the prescriptions. I asked whether taking vaccine after 24 hrs is effective or not? Whose answer should be either yes or no. But she gave a diplomatic answer saying its should be given within 24 hrs but we also suggest ppl the same even after they come after 6 months of dog:/cat bite. I asked whether i will be saved from rabies to which her answer was that i dont know and went on saying even uneducated people come within 24 hrs and educated ppl like u delay the same . To which i narrated whatever was the reason to my delay. And again she repeated the same line which obviously made me angry. Neither she provided me with a solution nor she answered my questions rather misguided me like before . The only thing she did was taunt me for nothing ( for being a patient ) i have huge respect to all the doctors out there but such unprofessionalism inhuman behaviour lack of respet for patients is unacceptable. But thankfully this place does have a small numbered good doctors. After my encounter with this lady doctor i was obviously not satisfied so went ahead to medicine opd where a another male doctor and a female doctor sat and said rabbies vaccine for recent bite shall be given within 24 hrs...
later which is given is the vaccine for future bites. So ovsly the scratch that i had gotten wouldnot have been treated if i took the vaccine 3 days later. Thanks to doctor in the medicine opd we need for doctors like you and non like the lady in female opd. If an educated person can be misguided by such doctors then I don't know what the uneducated might be facing . Hope the state government looks into the matter and teach a bit of professionalism to such doctors. Also I forgot the lady doctor also said “I don't know if this can prevent rabbies .. nei jao baki jaha bhagaban chahinbe“doctor bhagwan hain sunna tha ye toh haiwan nikli... inka bas chale toh logo ko khada khada maar dein.

More over a hospital staff says our phones are out of service so a patient can reach them he has to directly go to the hospital in order to get the treatment. Don't ever visit Usthi at all. Even govt. hospitals or block level hospitals will treat you better and you will get well soon. This is a honest feedback from my end. Hope this will save many lives.","Usthi Hospital & Research Centre","210",,,"3.6","1",
"6","If you are looking for a quick review, I would say visit this hospital only if u have deep pockets. It's expensive. If u are admitted, they will drain ur pockets sooner than your phone's battery.

We visited this hospital on 1st Nov,2021 and got my sister admitted for 3 days. U have to pay an upfront advance of 5k for admission which will used be for doctor, nurse services and bed charges only. For medicines and tests, u have to pay separately. The bed charges are okay. ₹1000 for general ward and ₹2500 for a private room which also includes food for patient.

The doctors over here are decent as well but it's expensive in my opinion. There were numerous tests which may have been necessary for diagnosis but every single test is overpriced. The RT-PCR test in KIMS is for ₹400 and u get the result in the same day. The same test here in Usthi is for ₹1000 and we didn't get the result that soon as well. A simple antigen test costs ₹500 which is more than RT-PCR in other hospitals. I will attach the receipts of other tests as well for reference. For a 3 day hospitalisation, we spent around ₹13-14k on tests alone, 8k on admission charges and 3-4k on medicines. Around 25k and the diagnosis was urine infection and calcium deficiency. Not that I wanted my sister to have more diseases but 25k for this is a lot.

They have their own pharmacy where the medicines are sold at MRP and  there is absolutely no discount even though u are buying everything from there.  All of that is still fine but they charge ₹600 for nurse services and ₹800 for doctor consultation every day. ₹600 and ₹800 for an in-patient consultation. This is bizzare. That means if u stay for one day in general ward and don't buy medicines and do tests, u still have to pay ₹2400.

On top of all of this, we had to fight with the management because, they charged the bed for 3 days and doctor consultation for 4 days. Thankfully they refunded us the extra ₹800 deducted as discount. The doctors are decent, the nurses are helpful and the hospital is also kept clean but I'm not visiting this hospital again because it's not affordable. I would rather visit SUM or KIMS. We regularly visit SUM hospital and the expenses are way less.","Usthi Hospital & Research Centre","210",,,"3.6","2",

If you are visiting the hospital be prepare for sleepless night and ready to tolerate the rude and unprofessional behavior from security team.  You will feel like you are not at Hospital you are at some bar and these security guard are bouncers,
if you question them they will assault you , physically harashed you, so be ready for all these stuff.

Their MRD team is a waste.  They will not work on your issues and if you ask question they refuse saying do what ever you want to do.

Also when you are getting admitted, do check the bills, they are master in billings unwanted stuff, I cross verified and found that some of the stuff they have returned but did not deducted from bills. So please cross verify all bills and what you are consuming.

Upon looking at their reviews in google I am assured that this is their old business and they will not take any action against their own Gunda employees. As they are behaving in such manner that they have full backup of their management.

My sister in law got admitted on 2nd July at 1.20 am in ICU for her cardiac issues. During admission the billing department gave a  cost breakup of per day charges which was around 19.2 k apart from the medicines and few other charges.

She will get discharged some time now around 6pm.

When I went for the final settlement of bill they gave me a bill of 45 k. When I went through the summary I found they have smartly added  many overheads.over my discussion  I found they are well trained to answer smartly with all of their mischievous things.

"6","Doctor behaviour is good (or at least our doctor's was, can't speak for others). However, rest of the personnel, especially security (badged SAINIK) are most primitive, uncivilised bunch you will ever come across. They cannot be termed as humans. Trust me, you can't imagine how they behave with patients and patient parties.

Most other hospital staffs are extremely uncooperative and unsympathetic as well. For instance, the LDC who was supposed to just put a seal on the reimbursement claim form, simply kept measuring and insulting me, and eventually didn't do his duty. Just imagine that you pay cash, then some callous clerk wouldn't do his job just because he's having fun harassing you. Most of the junior residents are bunch of gits as well.

Extremely racist place as well. It only suits the natives, tremendous amount of favouritism is done. The more drama you do, more uneducated you are, more suitable this institute will be for you.

The surrounding place is a typical village btw. Scarily unhygienic; cow dung and flies all around. Food poison guaranteed. Nearby shops take 10 rs for BW printouts, and 5 for photocopies, Lol. Nobody to question all these, because to question something, one needs a brain, and some form of basic education. Such a backward place!

Last but not the least, inside hospital premises there's no Jio network, I don't mean data, but even simple phone calls don't work. So you can't work. But let's leave your work, right? There's a tree nearby growing money, which will pay for your treatment. Lol.

Whatever said above is not exaggeration by any means, in fact quite the contrary. No words can explain the pathetic conduct of this hospital. Human rights are violated every hour.

Hence, the Institute is not fulfilling the purpose for which it was set up i.e to cure the critical patients of Odisha who are not able to afford high cost of medication.

Dr patil described our case very good to us and told ASD device closure can be attempted and we decided to go through on 31st of may. Finaly on May 31st ,my wife admitted and successfully done her ASD device closure. At Ot,Hdu she got good care and support.
On the next day she got discharged due to her stability. The overall billing , insurance & discharge process great. Due to clean and clear billing only 4000 was deducted by TPA at final billing of 1.86 lakh where as at Apollo hospital 12000 was deducted by TPA in a billing of 84000.

My wife had a miscarriage when she conceived for three months.

We were searching for a good Gynecologist in near by Bhubaneswar & got to know about Dr. Ashima Patra from one of my friend. Even we tried for kid after some months of miscarriage,my wife could not able to conceive.

We visited without pre appointment. Dr Ashima checked my wife.
Her behaviour was so nice that gave moral courage to her .she advised to reduce bodyweight,yogo and some medicine.

Three months after consultation my wife got conceived.

I would like to state that an elbow operation was conducted on 6th of August with the name of Ankit Das and I have come back to Bengaluru.As per discussion Dr Ravi Shankar asked me to consult whenever possible as on Aug 31st I was unable to meet him due to he had some operations. But, today when I asked the reception for consult with doctor the lady on the reception was rude and denied clearly and gave an illogical answer that if u book today appointment will be given on September 28th what a service from the top notch hospital Hats off to the lady call was made at 7.17 pm on 10th of September. Thanks for your service while taking the money it was like God and now not even a proper gesture. If the management is reading this they might be knowing how it is when a medical issues arises and is not solved being mentioned it is operated recently and needs attention.
Hope if their is bit of humanity and a proper set of discipline rules of management they will look over it. If not then it's better carrying a broken elbow rather than spending money at a place where it's zero patient satisfaction with regards to services and reception personnel at particular.","Shree Hospitals","645",,,"3.6","3",

Firstly, post taking the appointment they wants us to wait for 2-3 hours and when u approach them to ask an update "" How much time it will take"" they start shouting at us. If you don't have zeal to work on customer obsession then u can't run the hospital like this.

No doubt with the care and treatment given by the hospital and Dr Asima Patra. Looking into the overall experience as for delivery, it’s highly recommended. But you get the worst of behaviour and treatment by Dr Bikrant. He not only was rude at his behaviour but also was foul mouthed to a me, a patient who has just undergone C-sec holding a baby in lap and standing for more than 40mins while Doctor was busy treating and chitchatting with a patient from his private clinic; wherein he should prioritise the Ananya hospital patient first before his private clinic patients. He has used ridiculous words and actions for my parents too.  Worst Pediatrician in town.","ANANYA HOSPITAL","234",,,"3.3","1",

But my experience shows that Dr Prusty who happens to be paediatrician is not behaving properly with the lady patients of Ananya hospital .

This bill replaced an ordinance that allowed the six AIIMS—like institutes to become operational by September 2012.[5] Lok Sabha passed the AIIMS (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 30 August 2012.[6] The proposed measure helped the centre to change the status of the six new AIIMS registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act to be an Autonomous Corporate Body like the AIIMS in Delhi. AIIMS(Amendment) Bill, 2012 was introduced in Rajya Sabha on 3 September 2012[7][8] and passed on 4 September 2012.[9][10]
AIIMS Bhubaneswar is situated on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. It was built on about 100 acres of land in the Sijua neighborhood of Bhubaneswar.[16] AIIMS – Bhubaneswar is divided into three sections: a hospital, medical college, and residential complex. The hospital was built by AIIMS at a cost of ₹2.64 billion (US$37 million). Approximately ₹1 billion (US$14 million) was projected to be spent for the construction of the medical college and ₹500 million (US$7.0 million) for the construction of the student housing.[17] There will also be a 350-bed satellite location in Kalama village, Jaleswar block, Balasore district.[18] 978-bed AIIMS Bhubaneswar was inaugurated by Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Gulam Nabi Azad on 26 February 2014.[19]
The AIIMS Campus extends over 100 acres, consisting of the hospital complex and residential area. The hospital complex consists of a 900-bed multi speciality hospital with 43 departments. The Academic Area present in the complex houses the Academic Block, College of Nursing and Central Library. The Academic Blocks consists of 4 Lecture Halls and Departmental Labs of Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Forensic Medicine, Community Medicine. All the 41 departments have departmental cabins, labs, library room as well as conference rooms. A stationery and snacks outlet is also housed in the Academic Building. The Academic Building also houses the offices of Director, Dean, Admin and other staff departments like Finance, Electric, Engineers and the central library. The residential complex consists of three Boys hostels and two girls Hostels for Undergraduate Students of MBBS, Nursing and Allied Sciences. The hostels have an 800-room capacity. Four Postgraduate Hostels along with four Staff and Faculty Blocks are also present. The Director's Bungalow and Guest House is located near Main Residential Gate.","All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar","1941",,,"4.3","5",

The hospital had divided and conquered pretty successfully.If any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for alcoholics we appear somewhat sentimental, let them stand with us a while on the firing line, see the tragedies, the despairing wives, the little children; let the solving of these problems become a part of their daily work, and even of their sleeping moments, and the most cynical will not wonder that we have accepted and encouraged this movement. We feel, after years of experience, that we have found nothing which has contributed more to the rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic movement now growing up among them.","All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar","1941",,,"4.3","4",

Imagine riding your bike to the hospital only to find - there's no bike parking. What? You might ask, ""How are bikes not accounted for at a healthcare facility?"" This is a significant drawback that requires immediate attention.
Park at Your Peril under Heavy Sunlight
To make matters worse, the hospital's inadequate parking facilities leave you with no option but to park your vehicle under the scorching sun. But who takes responsibility if your vehicle suffers sun damage? The hospital’s disclaimer that you park your vehicle at your own risk further adds salt to the wound.
So, the question is, ""Why hasn't the hospital made adequate parking or appropriate shade provisions to protect vehicles?""","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","5023",,,"4.3","1",

Despite the doctors' efforts during his 10-day stay in the NICU, there was no improvement in his condition. Though he was responding by looking at us , and moving his hand and leg and yes due to the brain stroke he was not able to speak. We were in a hope that he will recover but unfortunately, after a trial period off the ventilator, he had to be put back on it due to his critical condition.

After a week, the doctors recommended a tracheostomy, which we agreed to, even though it meant stopping his medications for two days. However, tragedy struck when shortly after the procedure, my father left us forever during dialysis. It was heart-wrenching, especially considering that his creatinine levels were not alarmingly high.

We were left grappling with questions about the necessity of dialysis given the critical nature of my father's condition. As a common man, we trusted the expertise of the medical team, but now we wonder if it was the right decision. This experience has left us questioning the competence of the doctors Subhranshu Jena ( neurologist) who was treating neuro issues for my father or the doctor who involved in performing dialysis in the critical condition. These facts puts lots of questions on whether we can trust hospitals in similar situations in the future. I

Ultimately, regardless of who is to blame, the fact remains that I lost my father due to what feels like medical negligence. It's been over a month since his passing, but the pain and longing for him persist.","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","5023",,,"4.3","1",

"7","Sorry to write, but it's really disappointing and harassing.  I have been travelling to AIIMS 13-Jan-2023 for my umbilical hernia surgery.  Initially I was treated under the doctor Rahul Gupta and after so many days he told for the surgery, it might take 2-3 month to get admitted at the hospital.  Informed me that I will receive a call from the hospital between 2-3 months.  4 month passed when I again visited in April he told to wait for few more weeks and you will get a call.  Again one month passed, I went to meet Mr Rahul Gupta , he asked me to come on Friday for admission, I also went on Friday Bhadrak to Bhubaneswar (About 150 KM) and reached at AIIMs at 9AM. again he told bed is not available come on next Friday(26-05-23).  On 26-05, he was not available on his bench, I waited 1 hour - 1.5 hours approximately, he didn't came.  I went to meet another doctor from the same dept. DR Shantanu Kumar Sahu.  Finally I told all the story, he gave me a slip for admission.  After competition the formalities I went to the admission ward General Surgery F4 Ward, the staffs stared playing games. Told me to wait for 30mints to 1 hour (But the admission department already assigned me a bed).  I have waited till 5:50PM for the bed, they didn't provide me.  Again they told to wait for few hours.  When I asked when my Surgery will happen- In a single word they responded it will take 2-3 weeks for your number.  A healthy person will die with their behavior's and lengthy process.  And the behavior's of those students are disgusting.  I thing this is for powerful/ Political persons, not for general.  They just reserve the beds for powerful people.  No one is their to hear you.  Requesting AIIMS director and the administrations to change the process. If a good person will admit there for 2-3 weeks without any reason, he will be a big patient.","All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar","1941",,,"4.3","1",

Dr. Asima's name is branded properly since many years of hard work and professionalism. But I would request to take some time to look into the customer satisfaction to cut down inexperienced and in house profesionals which may ruin your reputation.

Pros :
1) Dr. Asima is an experienced professional and sober too.
2) Rooms are clean and properly sanitized.
3) In-house pharmacy and paediatrics are prompt to help you understand how the dosage should be taken. They even accept all type of UPI'S.

Cons :
1) COVID 19 situation - We understand the concept that only patient is allowed while consulting doctor,if so then why other patients are allowed (2-3) without proper check,
no social distance and sanitization. Which makes me beleive it's just only more & more patients for money.
2) The Junior doctors and sisters just don't care to explain the details to pateints/attendee about the diagnosis or reports. It's like reports done and everything seems normal so no need to asure or explain the patient about the reports or medications.
3) The worst part is while you are being diagnosed for observation with one of the doctors, immediate next  patient in queue is processed who were inside. Its like patient level loading concept.
4) The front staff executives - Especially the one who collects the cash and do the information fulfillment for patients thinks of himself as a some warden and people are just packages. Please have some professional behaviour towards or hire someone who can deliver with a smile post training as these guys are face of your organization. It's a hospital and we are paying for the doctor expertise not idiots like them.","ANANYA HOSPITAL","234",,,"3.3","1",

Myself Being a doctor I kno the consultation fees everywhere.
I don't know any hospital where doctor charges consultation fees & not putting the round notes & when asked the authority about this to check for why they transferred our baby to NICU,they said this is against the hospital laws to show the notes.
This is pure mockery of private practice & looting of the patients.

When i went to hospital, Bishwajit mishar told we don’t have room vacant. but we will keep your son in ICU but we will take single room charges.Next day when room vacant, they told your son is a ICU patient cant remove oxygen, his lung has damaged, sever  nimonia in chest, your son’s life is in risk condition.there is chest infection also in X-ray they also did HIV test which is not justified.

But thanks to Dr. Bichitra nanda rout sir for guid us and rescued from them(because he was out of state). According to him if lung damaged, then patient will take breath very fast.we are tracking past 5 days in oxygen meater there is no oxygen issue.

Next day 12pm they told to do some expensive examination & will take fluid from back bone(which pain may keep few year or lifetime).When I refused,they told to sign risk bond.But at 6pm when i told to discharge, they told your son’s condition has improved & we will shift to normal room. ((((Here my question is if one patient is so critical that they told to sign risk bond 12pm, but when i told to discharge how at evening 6pm patient get ok. Is there any magic like baba???))))

Their target is how to make more money by any unnecessary test or anything.They don’t care if patient dai. And staff behaviour is also rude .

After 4 days treatment in sara hospital , my son is good now.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","1",

"5","Hospital management and assigned doctors are money minded. They neglected baby health condition till 4 th day after delivery and the day of discharge they came (2-3 paediatric doctors) suddenly in filmy style and said your baby health condition is not good need to admit on hospital without any medical/pathological report. Their intention is to keep baby for 4-5 days more and charge hefty amount.

During discharge they prescribed FORMULA feed NAN PRO and PAPU Bottle . and after giving NAN PRO with Papu bottle my baby (4days baby) not taken breast milk. So this is also doctor trick.

So I didn’t agree with doctor and take my baby to CAPITAL HOSPITAL.

Because of doctor’s negligence my baby suffered.

Apart from Doctor, Nurse are not taking care of baby. They just slept during night shift.

Any way it’s my mistake, I had visited to this hospital in my own.

Post xray was done, the doctor wanted us to do blood tests and recommend to admit the kid in the hospital.  My son's health condition  was serious according  to the doctor. The diagnosis  process was to instill fear in my mind and get my so admitted to the hospital than treatment.

I got out of the hospital took a second opinion and found out that nothing was close to serious and with nominal medicine my son recovered. I was also told that carrying out xray was uncalled for.

The hospital  is focused on minting money with zero focus towards treatment/ service. The doctor (Dr Vidya Patwari) in my case was a better actor than doctor.

Date was 8th Feb and my father went to dr debadarshi Rath with problems regarding urine.
Doctor said it needed operation but that was operated 2 times before.
Then we went to other doctors manas pradhan (amri), sunil swain (cuttack).They both said- "" where to operate? It's fine and clear""

Conclusion - Debadarshi understand the patient situation, you were never recognized and now hope you shall be banned.

Everyone who wishes to go to maxfort can go for other doctors,but would recommend not debadarshi.

"2","They (Satyam Hospital) provide whatever you want Normal or Caesarean with 24hr services.

The Satyam Hospital deserves 5 star for the cooperation of their staff (All of them reside there 24hrs). Regarding cleanliness, they definitely need to improve. But they're charging the least in comparison to others and they are not money minded. Yes, some of the nursing staff are young and they are learning the critical parts of delivery but still they are better than others.

If you need normal deliveries with a good hospitality you may go there and if you need Hotel like facilities there are many options in Bhubaneswar.","Satyam Hospital","37",,,"3.9","5",

If you or any of your family members are getting admitted here then please be ready to face problems, you need to carry the patient on stretcher by yourself only. No 24 hrs service.

The renowned gynaecologist advised for an NST(which is unnecessary according to other doctors). She(Dr) checked the report and prescribed for immediate delivery as the report showed the baby had absolutely less movements. The mother of the baby kept telling ""Ma'am I can feel it's activities pls check again"". Replying to the mother, Dr said ""We are experts not you""

After a few enquiries, we consulted with Dr N. Agasti and the mother normally delivered a baby at Satyam Hospital after EDD. All the staff were very cooperative at Satyam and they made us comfortable till discharge.","Satyam Hospital","37",,,"3.9","5",

I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the extent treatment at Ankura Hospital, under the care of Dr. Leena Das, for my  daughter- in - law pregnancy and delivery. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism, setting the tone for what turned out to be an exceptional journey.

Dr. Leena Das's expertise and compassion were evident from our very first consultation. She took the time to listen to my concerns and preferences, providing personalized care tailored to my needs. Throughout my daughter - in - law pregnancy, Dr. Das ensured that I was well-informed about every step of the process, addressing any questions or anxieties I had with patience and clarity.

The prenatal care at Ankura Hospital was comprehensive and top-notch. From routine check-ups to specialized tests, every aspect of  health and the baby's well-being was meticulously monitored. The hospital facilities were modern and comfortable, creating a soothing environment for expectant mothers like my daughter - in - law

When the time came for delivery, I felt completely confident in Dr. Das's capable hands. Her expertise and calm demeanor reassured throughout the labor process, making what could have been a stressful experience much more manageable. Thanks to her skillful guidance, my daughter - in - law had a smooth delivery, and I felt supported every step of the way.

Overall, my experience with the extent treatment at Ankura Hospital and with Dr. Leena Das exceeded my expectations in every aspect. I would highly recommend their services to any expectant mother seeking exceptional prenatal care and delivery experience.

"3","I have been to 45 countries on work and have been to hospitals in at least half of them for OPD work, Dentistry, to visit colleagues undergoing care or for visa related tests. I am from Bhubaneswar and my mom ( a doctor herself) was treated in Bluewheel (OPD and IP) for Cardiology and Neurology issues and I'd rate this hospital world class both in terms of facilities as well as expertise. Very good support staff - nursing and housekeeping etc, transparent (For example they show returned medicines in the bill), relatively smaller in size (100 bedded I guess) but standards as good as that of any class hospital around in the country (Fortis, Apollo etc) and some really good doctors. Nursing staff are very well trained in soft skills to deal with In Patients and relatives. Dr Dibya Ranjan Behra (Cardiologist) and Dr Deepak (Radiologist) are top class. I hope nobody has to ever visit a hospital but if you are in Bhubaneshwar and have to, I'd recommend them.
The establishment is new and I hope that they retain their standards as they get older and popular. The head of the hospital Dr Sandeep is very reachable as well. They have clear processes, I had to get documents for insurance claim and their MRD manager Mr Narayan was super knowledgeable and knew what I needed. Canteen needs improvement, that's a bit of a scar in an otherwise great establishment.","Blue Wheel Hospital","480",,,"4.4","5",

We were already using it from the best brand

When I asked him
He simply said take the one I have written

Without explaining anything

Secondly another medicine which was working perfectly for our purpose and giving results , I don’t know why he
Changed that and gave a very strong medicine with more side effect

Why was that even needed I don’t know

"10","Dr. Pratap Kumar Behera - worst Doctor I have ever seen. His treatment, behaviour and even his mannerisms are the worst. I took my 4 year old daughter, who had been suffering from a high fever, to the hospital at 5.00am on Dec 14, 2022.  He is not at all concerned about parent's worries. He is very reluctant and care less in answering parent's queries. He didn't even check the patient's condition properly and immediately advised two antibiotics and also advised us to conduct malaria, typhoid and other tests. He even suggested us to admit her in the hospital. We didn't follow his advice and took a second opinion from another doctor who understood our concerns and advised us not to conduct any tests and use only one antibiotic for 3 days. Within one day, my baby fever subsided.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","1",
"11","Although I wanted to give 4-5 stars, unable to do so…The best part of this hospital is Dr. Biswajit sir and couple of other doctors. It’s a very sad story for rest of the portion. The amenities and support staff is pretty bad barring few. Team of nurse did a channel for antibiotic for my 5 months old daughter, even after numerous request they forcefully did in the hand where vein was not visible. Today again one of the best nurse did mention that it’s very improper and need to be done once again. This is the third channel in 4 days and sanitisation is something this hospital need to learn. Cleanliness has to be followed and proper look out is required. Aweful it is…expecting a response over email and here as well.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","3",

Even they couldn’t prepare the labour room and my wife gave birth in dormi. Still noone was present to attend. Their excuse was there was another cesarean going on but how the entire staff was engaged in that. We were not provided any cabin even after requesting multiple times. When we wanted to leave the hospital due to lack of cabin facility, we were told one cabin will be made available in one hour which never happened. Even after our doctor urging the hospital for a cabin, they still remained dormant. My experience is so bad regarding this and I hope noone faces the same","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","1",
"11","What can I say.
1. Behaviour of staff is rude
2. There is continuous effort to extract maximum money from patient
3. Faced miscarriage, baby was dead in 3rd month. Check up was done by doctor but did not inform us, instead asked us to go for scan as it will fetch them 12000 Rs. After scan on 4th month , came to know baby died in 3rd month only.
4. My wife was bleeding and I request interim meet with doctor but she sticked to the queue.
5. Request and Pleading failed on all levels due to staff behaviour who forcefully asked me to respect him.
Still if you want to go there. It's your risk.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","1",
"4","This is a review for the late night emergency care. Our caretakers son (5 yrs old) suddenly had a severe allergic reaction at night, as my father took him to jagannath hospital considering its a pediatric hospital the late night doctor was simply rude and annoying.
I have a lot of respect for doctors and understand that they are always under a lot of stress but his behaviour was extremely unpleasant to a point where the staff intervened and helped us out.
That doctor refused to answer any of my question and only gave one word reply. He was extremely unprofessional and simply disregarded my caretakers family worries and queries. I visited the hospital on 14th dec, 2022 at 10.30. I don't remember the doctor's name but I hope the hospital improves its doctors and staff behaviour when parents are in distress.
P.S. I just want to point out an additional information. While leaving the hospital a staff came out and asked if we are from Rabindra Surgicals, they probably recognised my father who is the owner and their behaviour did a 180 turn. They started being nice and speaking politely and helped us understand the doctor's diagnosis. I don't think pulling names should be the only criteria where i get good medical care.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","1",

"0","Dear   SPARSH HOSPITAL  Management,

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the treatment my mother received at your hospital. Our recent experience has been extremely distressing due to the unprofessional behavior and negligence displayed by your staff.

On two separate occasions, the saline drip was left open, resulting in saline spilling everywhere instead of being administered to my mother. Such carelessness is unacceptable in any medical facility, as it directly affects patient care and safety.

Furthermore, a nurse named Rupali exhibited a highly unprofessional attitude. She not only neglected her duties but also behaved rudely towards my mother. Adding to our distress, the security guard instructed us to throw our belongings outside, further exacerbating an already stressful situation.

A hospital is a place where patients and their families expect compassionate and professional care. The rude and unprofessional behavior of your staff, including the nurse and security guard, is deeply disappointing and unacceptable. We are not receiving free treatment; we expect and deserve respectful and competent care.

I urge you to address these issues immediately. Your staff must be trained to communicate politely and handle their responsibilities with the utmost care. This is not only essential for patient well-being but also crucial for maintaining the reputation of your hospital.

We will be posting this review on Google to inform others about our experience. We hope that swift and effective actions will be taken to ensure that no other patient has to endure what we have been through.

Sincerely,

Nirupama Swain","SPARSH HOSPITAL, KANTABADA","190",,,"4.1","1",

When we met him he sat 10 meters away and did not even examine my son physically. He just said why are u, and when we said we r travelling the next day then he replied so what, i can't do anything. When i started saying what led to his symptoms he said he is not interested in listening to that. He just wrote a prescription and when i said what are these drugs for he said don't ask qsns to me , nurse will explain the dosage. I just wasted my time and effort and walked out of the hospital.

illiterate dumbs!!

When i reached to the hospital as per the scheduled date and time , the hospital staff refused to give the vaccine without any prior information and shifted the slot to next day.  In this pandemic situation this kind of behaviour is not acceptable. I have spent around rs. 500 to reach the location and is for no use. This is a hospital or any mall i just do not get it.

"3","POOR FACILITIES AND HIGH DEMAND OF MONEY.
Even they don't have a proper sugar monitoring machine.
Nurses are Ill mannered, NOT WELL TRAINED. They take their own time and bring the medicines from the hospital pharmacy. EVEN THEY can't Find A VEIN TO INJECT SALINE, hence they are giving trial methods of injecting one after another.
And if we'll communicate such things to the higher ups, they will retaliate against the patient and straight away they will say to take out the patient from their hospital.
PLZ DON'T TAKE UR DEAR ONES TO SUCH KIND OF HOSPITAL IF U WANT TO SAVE THEM.

AC was not working properly and suddenly it stopped working at night. Management didn't take any kind of proper solution, they just send a dirty air cooler, which was throwing dirty black water. My family suffered a lot, coz there was no proper ventilation in that room and that room was really hot and humid. One more thing you can get in the cabins are woodworms.

I visited hospital on 30th Dec, 2020. I must tell you a big NO, don't visit this hospital. Very rude doctor, poor skills, ill equipped with knowledge and necessary instruments. Pediatrician(BRUTI RANJAN ROUT), a shameless item definitely need training. Wasted my time, money and energy.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","1",

"2","One of the best place in city for Gynaecology and Pediatrics. The give special attention for every case they handle. 24 hours availability of experienced doctors to attain any emergency or causality.","Jagannath Hospital","380",,,"3.4","5",
"2","Worst hospital. Only advertising no treatment doing. Money marking hospital. Even the renowned doctor is busy in money making. He forgets about his sole objective of being a doctor. Due to this No educated and well known people are not coming, only poor people are coming and returning from hospital being incomplete treatment and being looted.  All the staffs are work. They arecheating most to BSKY card holders","Sushruta hospital and trauma care Pvt Ltd","139",,,"3.8","1",
"2","My experience with the hospital was really horrible. This overall 2 star rating is only for Dr Akshaya Rout otherwise the management and staffs need zero rating. I went through a day care procedure on 20 June 2023, the day before i.e..on 19 June was asked to be present at 3 pm to complete the formalities for daycare and they inform that everything would be done by 5pm. However i was taken to OT at around 7:30 pm.
Doctor Mr A K Rout was not informed on time about the day care and so it was delayed.
2 days later when I visited them again for dressing, none of the staffs paid attention to it and after waiting for an about 1 hour till 10:20 am I had to leave for the office. I request OT staffs and the staff nurse to do the necessary dressing but none took interest in it.
Later I came to know that the dresser was late for the shift.

I visited them again the next day for dressing and I was charged Rs 180 for putting a Rs 2 bandaid on the wound.

I visited them on 10 July 2023 to get the stitches cut and removed but again no one was there to take care of it. The staff nurse and the front office management were unable to call anyone from OT nor the dresser for the procedure.
At last I visited Capital Hospital and got my stitches removed.
I even asked the front office executives for the doctor's number but none provided it.
Its really really frustrating and i feel sad about the situation I went trough. Patient should not be handled such a way
I understand there are different duties assigned to different persons but when some one is in trouble then what should you do?
Akshay Sir you really have to look into this.","Sushruta hospital and trauma care Pvt Ltd","139",,,"3.8","2",

Even doctors are very rude to you saying take your patient anywhere if you want to upon asking about the treatment and medicines.

My father was very nervous and reluctant for the surgery at this old age of 66. Sir was so humble and gave confidence to my father. Finally his surgery has done and he is fine now. All the staffs of the hospital were very cooperative during our hospital stay and they make sure that all the patients should feel comfortable.

When complained, we were responded to but without any fruitful or visible actions taken with immediate effect.

They charge ICU 5500 MONITOR extra, oxygen extra , ventilator extra, all necessary things in ICU charged extra. Patient admitted for 16 days but charged for 32 CT SCAN worth 70500.

Highly disappointing experience towards unprofessionalism of Dr Rout.
However, Dr K D Das tried but can only do so much on behalf of Dr Rout for saving face value.
So thank you Dr Kumar🙏
Noteworthy employee from Management would be Shubham...really helpful guy n perfect team with Dr Kumar.
But experience is bitter due to Dr Rout.

However there is no foult of Doctors they are too Good. Requesting admin to charge attending staff.","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","1",
"5","First impression is not good. For a simple consulation they charged 600. Isn't it too high for a hospital like this? I know some very good hospitals which charge less. Also somehow I didn't feel good about the place. My first and last visit there. Pls visit at your own risk and read other reviews before you visit.","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","1",
"10","Worst Hospital and facilities, my wife got a c section infection after 2 months of delivery. consultaed with experts doctors from other hospitals they said it’s a operation theatre infection, if the instruments are not sterilised the call infection will carry to other patients operated. After the infection maa SHAKTI hospital called us for dressing for 5-6 times but due to poor diagnosis infection increased. My wife got re operated again in another hospital. It’s a sincere request to all of you to raise voice against MAA SHAKTI Hospital, and save your near and dear ones. This hospital is still operating and many more cases will still arise…. Please spread awareness!!!! And save your loved ones..","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","1",

"11","Worst hospital for motherhood. If you are expecting a healthy baby with healthy mother, don't come here. Cleaning is worst. If you walk in any corridor or any cabin , your foot becomes black. Hospital is very little aware about sterility of equipments to be used for surgery. Post surgery Pus, abdominal pain, infection within 01-02 months is a must. My wife has undergone 02 surgeries at AMRI due to unhygienic & Non- equipment use. If you ask it's staff , then they respond as if they studied in Harvard university. My suggestion, you may go for unit-6 Capital Hospital, but don't go for it.","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","1",
"13","Very bad experience. I delivered my baby girl in this hospital...The nurses and other staffs are niether professional nor well behaved..They are very rude and even don't take proper care of the newborn...The room which was a costly one but not up to the mark and the room were not cleaned properly . I recommend everyone not select this hospital for delivery I had also experienced post caesarian complications and moving the hospital repeatedly...I also had bad experience with some of the doctors ...I can understand that they are over burdened but still they should not lose their tempe.r","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","2",
"6","I would rate the facility as average. I would have given it ""poor"" rating, but they have some good doctors. The problem is with the sisters and nurses. Most of them seem untrained and unprofessional. I've seen this not once or twice but many times. Looks like no one is taking a notice. The nurses and sisters are insensitive to the patient and their family, who are obviously going through a lot when visiting a hospital. Instead of alleviating the customers pain, they raise complaint against the customers to the doctors.

This hospital could be one of the best available in the city, but maybe hampered by some poor quality nurses.

Hope someone takes a notice.","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","3",

"8","I went to this hospital for my father's hydrocele operation. And I think this was one of the worst mistakes I ever made in my life. My overall experience in the hospital was horrible. The hydrocele operation I went there for was somehow successful, but within two days of the procedure my father experienced severe pain in his chest and abdomen. Eventually he was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Since, my father is non-alcoholic and there was no such reason to develop pancreatitis at that time, a renowned Medicine Specialist whom I later visited told me that this could be due to the surgical aparatus used during the operation not sterilised properly. They didn't have a medicine specialist at their hospital and the visiting doctor who was supposed to visit my father didn't care to visit in spite of multiple requests and I had to take my father, who was in unbearable pain, to his clinic on my own. The nurses in the hospital were so overburdened that they would visit the patient to change his drip only after multiple requests. The hospital didn't have basic things like slippers, buckets and mats in the ward, though they charge a hefty fee. There is no arrangement of food suitable for patients either in the hospital or nearby. Finally, I won't recommend this hospital even to my worst enemy.","Maa Shakti Hospital","201",,,"3.4","1",

I wanted to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care and professionalism you provided to my son this morning. From the moment we arrived at the hospital, your swift action and reassuring demeanor put us at ease during a very distressing time.

Dr. Rout, your expertise and dedication were evident as you swiftly assessed the situation and guided us through the process of removing the metallic ball from my son's stomach. Your decision to involve the pediatric team, particularly Dr. Janaki, ensured that my son received the specialized care he needed.

I am immensely thankful for the support staff who worked tirelessly to facilitate the necessary procedures, from arranging the X-ray to handling billing efficiently.

Allowing us, as parents, to be present during the procedure meant a lot to us, and it speaks volumes about your commitment to patient-centered care.

Thanks to your collective efforts.
Your compassion and expertise have made a significant difference in our lives, and we will always be grateful for your exceptional care.

With heartfelt appreciation,","AMRI Hospitals - Information Centre & Superspecialty Clinic","67",,,"3.9","5",

The staffs here also treat patients as they are doing some favour to the patient. Not recommended at all.

I must say the hospital might have done better if they communicated that this is the normal flow of events. It is the only point they should improve. Otherwise skepticisms aside and baring a few stray episodes with may b 1-2 employees the experience overall was very good. Great doctor and great care from all the staff.

I did not face any issue in hospital as well as with staffs.

Following points can be considered as an improvement area.
1. Mam should visit at least 1-2 time in day for all patients though she is keeping all upto date information because attendant should get clarity regarding patient condition and should be worried.
2. Introduce paper packet for take away parcel.

"5","My patient was admitted here for delivery and LSCS done here by out side doctor as she was under his supervision. After two days she was discharged with newborn baby. Though, we are not fully satisfied but somehow accepted  nursing and other services. After two days baby got admitted affected in jundice. In the blood test report name age etc. mentioned wrongly. In our several request and after third times wrong report submitted, finally report given in 5 days but that is also wrong. Instead of 5 days old baby they have mentioned 7 days old baby. We are admitted in a private cabin. Our Doctor Mr. Vijay Kumar K is a very nice person and we all are very happy with his behavior and treatment.  But, in private cabin, if a doctor just comes for rounding and says nothing but only asks that are you fine or not and goes away, still they are changing the doctor's fees in the final bill. Even on the discharge day though we are discharged at 10.00 a.m which was already decided by the doctor previous day, they have charged 2 times doctors fee. We have pointed out this but nobody listen. Behavior of receptionist and sisters are also disappointed.","Aspire Hospital","86",,,"3.9","2",
"6","If you want to get patient well soon then please don't come to this hospital.

They just suggest too many tests in which some are not even required.

If you're admitted in private cabin, if a doctor just comes for rounding and says nothing but only asks that are you fine or not and goes away, still they will add the doctor's fees in your final bill, like why? what did the doctor even consult? I stayed 9 days there and 36000rs was just the doctors fees!

Results come very late here. The results which should come in 2-3 days, they just make it late and gives the result report after 7 days. Even after complains, they just don't listen.

Some tests are not even available here, they make you go to another hospital just for tests.

Private Cabin charge is just expensive here; They take 4000rs per day. Rooms walls are not clean and full of stains. The Hospital doesn't even have that much facilities and is small but why such an outrageous amount for a day?

They do not take direct actions on complains. They make you wait for your complain to be on action.

If you want to admit your patient, take him/her to Sum Hospital or KIIMS, but not here.

Everything mentioned above are directely the experiences of a patient who stayed there. Nothing fake is mentioned here. If you do not believe, you can go waste your money your wish, but just to be cautious, never suggest this hospital...","Aspire Hospital","86",,,"3.9","1",
"6","Can you refund 800 which was charged today without any prescription?

Somehow I found very unprofessional attitude.

First of all very high charge and secondly I didn't do the unnecessary testing as suggested by other doctor outside aspire.  Why should I pay consult fees here without prescription.

Please be professional with people here.

Why should I pay 800 without prescription?

Looking for quick refund to avoid further legal action.","Aspire Hospital","86",,,"3.9","1",
"2","The hospital is very neat and  clean, Consultant Doctors are excellent  and staffs are fairly ok. Discharging takes very very long hours. Sisters are very good but they should not disturb patients whole night. The moment the patient feels  asleep they wake up and ask how is the patient. They should realise that patient feels very painful and wants little rest. They should adjust injection and tablets accordingly. Few hours before or after won’t make much difference. Some sisters kiss the new born to show their love and caring,  They should know that the new born has very low immunity and also they may be transferring  various hospital acquired infection. Also few resident doctors should be taught to be more polite and less arrogant.","Aspire Hospital","86",,,"3.9","4",

As we all face everywhere rude behavior, here is different, from receptionist to nurse attendant to housekeeper, all are very soft hearted and care and value the pain of patient. I like their attitude towards patient. A patient/attendant always a less visitor to hospital,we don't frequently go there, so common public sometimes visit to face his bad times, due to patients ignorance, rude behavior of staff creates hate  for hospital. But here staffs don't get irritated if you ask some question frequently.

"8","I was admitted in Aspire from the 23rd to 30th of January with severe weakness, dehydration & nausea. Must say that the general quality and level of medical care was satisfactory. Medical support staff and doctors are competent and treated me with requisite care that aided my speedy recovery.
However, the reason for my low rating is the poor administration combined with glaring errors in the billing and check out process that dampened my overall experience. Under the 'Covid' label, they tend to randomly overcharge on a number of items ranging from medical care to consumables. More importantly, there is zero flow of information about the billing or charges being incurred on a regular basis, and access to their senior staff from the patient's side is severely restricted.
They also need to upgrade to digital platforms for record keeping and sharing with patients as printed reports and files are old school.
I do hope that they up their ante on this front, as otherwise they have a good team and can emerge as a leading health care provider in Odisha. Thank you and best of luck to Aspire.","Aspire Hospital","86",,,"3.9","2",

"9","First of all If you have at least 30k budget then go there and cesarean delivery is 100% not normal because in 7days i saw all the same case even who monthly checked up there continuously they said this will be normal.

then after delivery they don't care mother at all even in 7days once not any doctor comes to ask if mother is ok or any problem, only cares for baby and charges 9k extra for that so they will not release before 7days.

except good talking of Dr. Saudamini all others don't know how to talking with good human beings as human being.

Lastly i think the good reviews of here given by them because after read good review  I admitted my wife there but realized what written above.","Maternity Care Hospital - Best Womens Hospital in Bhubaneswar","172",,,"3.6","1",

1-Neat and clean should be followed.
2-Receptions are not hearing to the patient promptly they are busy in their work like watching TV.
3-some staffs are not friendly they are showing rude behavior with the patient as well as attendant.
4- less number of rooms so if you need a rooms you need request them for a room ...my question is why patient will request she has rights to for delivery there.
5-not taking care of patients well but taking sufficient charges for this.
6-they can encourage and if denied they will make you fear for scissoring /operation for delivery.
7-don't have a parking area if you are coming with cars be careful,you car is in risk it will be in a out side area.
8-operation theater nurses are rude in behavior.
9-now a days every where medicine store are giving 10% to 15% discount but they will must deny you to give a discount .
10-maximum medicines are not available out side of that medicine store.","Maternity Care Hospital - Best Womens Hospital in Bhubaneswar","172",,,"3.6","1",

Expect the doctor , cash counter and medicine counter people the other women who are alloted for providing services they are busy with their phones but don't have sense to receive the hospital call.

Even some government hospitals are cleaner and better behaved. Their staff is extremely ill mannered. The doctor hardly gives 5 mins to one patient. Only during my first visit she spoke to us properly and after that all appointments were for 5 mins only. The staff will shout on you on call and sometimes even hang up if you request for an urgent appointment. The doctor scolds patients and behaves as a school principal. If you get tests or ultrasound done outside then she will throw your report saying its incorrect. I was so scared of her during my visits. Will never recommend anyone if you are planning to visit for pregnancy. I am thankful to God that i changed my doctor at the correct time.","Kar Clinic & Hospital","656",,,"3.7","1",

The doctor shouldn't behave improperly just bcoz the patient wants better clarification regarding the cause of the pain. The patient has all the rights to take steps or to crosscheck the treatment from another doctor. Any doctor shouldn't get irritated just bcoz the patient visited another doctor to get convinced about the actual cause of the pain or about the treatment procedure. There are several medical cases where patients regret of not consulting another doctor n consulting one doctor as the only option available.","Medcare Hospital & Research Center","57",,,"3.7","1",
"5","Not satisfied with the services...
Doctors are experienced but their behavior is too nasty in nature....
Emergency ward is not cleaned, they don't even clean the dressing bed regularly...
Management dont care about their employees...
They don't give the salary properly...
I dont know how the employees are stayed in this hospital without salary on their most crucial age....!!!!! Interns ko bhi ajj kal salary milti hai......
Environment is not clean,,, drainage smell comes inside the hospital and most disgusting smell come out,..
This not hospital for patients and employees... It's all ""Hell"".... Not recommend at all. .. .","Medcare Hospital & Research Center","57",,,"3.7","1",

The whole place is full of cheerful and compassionate people who genuinely want to help you heal. They are honest and if they say they can treat you, you can trust them fully, as they know what they are doing. Dr. Satyajit Mohanty has very good knowledge and understanding and explains the situation patiently with scientific facts. Dr. Abinash Mishra was very patient ,cheerful and compassionate.

I usually visited this hospital for eye related problem and Doctor s.skar never disappointed me . Today I visited this place with one friend  for a checkup with Dr. Sujata Kar. Believe me she is a horrible doctor as well as human being. She did not listen to whatever patient told . She told her point irrespective of patients pain. And multiple time she told to patient that why she came to her . What the hell , you are a doctor and your job is to guide patient and treatment . Don't act like you owned all patients. I felt like she was very much busy in calling next patient after money received. Very inhuman and stupid behaviour she showed. Means collect money from patient and just sold them, that's what going on with this pathetic Dr. (Dr. Sujata Kar). Please never visit this Dr orelse  you will be in big trauma of loosing your money without even treated.","Kar Clinic & Hospital","656",,,"3.7","1",

Staffs behaviour very bad. Cleanness is not there, no body listen to you.. Blood drop was there from morning I told to them for cleaning but now it's evening 08:00pm the floor is dirty like before.. One guy is here I don't know his name but he is behaving like he is a doctor and he don't care about anything...Here is no option to upload photos otherwise I'll show it..They are charging too much, for a middleclass family it's too much.. According the price service is ZERO.
They are not maintaining hygiene.

After the 1st consultation, with Dr Shashi, I felt comfortable as he explained me the various stages and probable issues.

Throughout my pregnancy Dr Shashi monitored and gave me necessary advice.

This not only made me more confident but also helped alleviate all the fears that I had : going to be a 1st time mother.

When I had the labour pain at the dead of the night he advised me to get admitted immediately & he along with his team were present at the Nursing Home. It had all the necessary arrangements.

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall cleanliness and with the caring attitude of the sisters post delivery as well. The staff is really helpful post delivery right from helping feed the baby periodically to maintaining the hygiene levels.

All essentials required for the new born are also available within the nursing home & one doesn’t have to go outside to search for the same.

I am thankful to Dr. Shashi and his team.

Post my experience, I would recommend all my near & dear ones to consult Women and Child Care Hospital.","Women and Child Care Hospital","59",,,"4.5","5",

"3","Worst hospital I have ever visited.

Biggest turndown: my new born got infected with COVID-19, all of us family members got tested and found negative. However, the hospital management were not clearly tested their staffs even after suggesting them.

Some of the other issues we faced there:

No lift even for patient, in sever labor pain also, they made me walk up the staircase.

No medicine store.

Can't get food even for patient.

The best room (they call it, ac delux) is also dirty. Doors doesn't stop or lock smoothly, toilet has dirt stains.

Water from the washbasin flows very close to the washbasin itself (difficult to use).

A/C is there, but remote will always be with nurses.

One has to call the reception number from their own mobile phone each time to call nurse. There is a common landline phone outside the room for all the six rooms on the floor.

OT floor also looks unclean. There were small flies lurking around my new born child in the OT area, that I had to repetitively tell the nurses to protect the child from all that.

NICU facility is just a mock, they do not follow the required hygiene.

Duty doctor there seems uneducated to me, can't even talk properly. Could not talk to my husband in English (my husband doesn't know the local language)","Women and Child Care Hospital","59",,,"4.5","1",

"3","Sharing my personal experience: Worst place ever because i will not call it a hospital or a nursing home or a physiotherapy centre. First of all they are so much money minded and rude especially the so called Doctor (Owner) of there. They are doing only and only business. Last yr we had stayed there for my father in law after his brain stroke surgery. They just kept taking advantage of our bad situation. They always forced to take medicines and other surgical products from their personal medicine store only. They said the per day charges to be 2thousand but after adding so many extra charges they kept making our daily bills of more than 3thousand per day. They could have told before about the extra charges but they just said that as 2thousand. The doctor dont take care of patients he only comes at night fr a hour and just asks is everything fine or not. Does not see the test reports , current complications etc. Only writes so many costly tests to do from their tied up laboratories for commission. Everything is based on business only.  Please don't trap urself at such risky place.","Santosh Memorial Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation Centre","65",,,"3.8","1",

"1","This physiotherapy centre is good for acute period diseases. The staff members are very good in their profession. The physiotherapist are very well trained and have the capability to transform the patient from 10% to 70-80% improvement. My uncle was also admitted to this physiotherapy centre 5 months back after undergoing craniotomy and then also underwent cranioplasty. Our neurosurgeon also admitted that the condition he discharged the patient after craniotomy and the present status speaks a lot that the kind of physiotherapy done was excellent.
The nursing staff (not all)are also very cooperative with the patient as well as to the attendant. The PCA staff are also very cooperative. The main plus point of this centre that they can get you the best doctor's consultation in shortest time.
But, there are some loop holes:-
1) If something serious occurs then the nursing staff have to contact their nursing in-charge and then they will convey it to the doctor's rather than directly contacting to the doctor.
2) They charge high amount for treatment , nearly double the actual cost.
Although, of all these the overall experience of mine with this Physiotherapy centre was excellent.  I will advice to bargain with the administration for getting best treatment  at low cost.","Santosh Memorial Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation Centre","65",,,"3.8","4",

And then I contacted the hospital and booked an appointment with the doctor right away. Let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed with anything at all, be it the registration process, consultation, diagnosis, surgery, staff support, amenities or the ambience, everything was brilliant. The doctor himself, Dr Debadarshi Rath is a pure gentleman with lots of knowledge and experience in the subject but most importantly, carries a brilliant personality. It was an honor to meet him and let my uncle undergo treatment by him.

Thank you Doctor and UNCE! Cheers! 👍

Dr Debadarshi Rath is such a well behaved, kind hearted person with an expertise in the field. My husband was under treatment by him and it was diagnosed that a stone was inside his kidney and he went through PCNL surgery, which was successfully done pretty smoothly. The best part is that the process is quick unlike the older way of surgery. The facilities in the hospital, the staff, the ambience, everything is appreciable.

Anyone looking for treatment for Uro related problems. This hospital is a must visit.

Thank you UNCE and thank you Doctor!

"3","One of the worst places for treatment. Please read my experience if you are planning to visit this hospital after reading google reviews.

1- This is not a hospital but an advanced clinic, so do not expect any good administration services.

2- Treatment: The doctor did some blood tests and all other tests and despite of seeing my creatinine levels are on the borderline, the doctor gave me injections and medicines which further worsened my condition. My creatinine levels was 1.3 and he gave me injections and pain killer which are not good for Kidneys and then it shoot to 2.87. Who does that?

3- On the prescription they give a certain phone number and they will not respond to it, neither whatsapp or call.

4- There was no person to give an injection, so Dr Rath called pharmacist and the pharmacist gave me injection. Few days afterwards - there was a huge clot.

5- They do not sell medicines of good company - Their medicines you won't get anywhere and they cost huge.

I went to this hospital by searching best urology hospital in Bhubaneswar and I suffered a lot and my condition is bad. The urologist knows that my creatinine is on borderline still he gave me lots of pain killers effecting kidneys. What kind of a doctor does that? Please avoid this.

Note: There are many paid reviews, please watchful.","Uronephro Center Of Excellence ( Best Urology Hospital in Bhubaneswar)","104",,,"4.7","1",

Its a big scam. Dont bother going to this place. Lot of better diagnostic centres are nearby. The cashier thinks we are fools. Asks for 500 for an X ray when the receipt clearly mentions that it is 400 and they have to return 100 for the 500 I will pay. I feel pity for people who are in urgent need or are not that much educated.

I had to wait for 1 hr before even I got to the cashier. Very unprofessional behaviour. Upon questioning they are adamant that I dont understand what is written in the receipt. Please avoid this place under all circumstances.

And yes Dr.Girija prasad mohanty was incredible.Seriously Its very very rare to find such a doctor like girija sir that one combines a lots of experience and professional care for their patients.Even you wont beleive he only called me from his side to know the condition of both mother and the child a no.of times....

Cashier desk was also good.
Price was good.
And yes you can negotiate some amount(its secret😉)

Every person i met over there right from receptionist to nurses to my doc.Girija mohanty and finally to the owner were found very caring and very helpful.

"1","It’s a wonderful experience at this hospital as stated below
1. I have done one of my eye at this hospital 3 month back.
2. Today I went there for my 2nd eye surgery and there I got a shocking news that my  previously surgery eye is not good as per the doctor Bidisha and told me that “ Aapka surgery achha nahi hua hai”
3. I am non diabetic but there I got test in GLUCOMETER and having 257mgdl ( I had a coffee over there 1 hour before), and after waiting for around 5hr they refused me to do the surgery, I just want to know that does glucometer report is valid report to do or cancel any surgery , there the lady who tested my blood using used needles to make the test, when I asked her to change needle she said we don’t have new one and again pinched me with previously open needle.
4. Kindly answer my 2 questions

* What is the defect of my previously surgery eye done at your hospital 3 months back for which I have spent Rs.19400 , as informed me by your doctor Bidisha .
* Do glucometer report valid for any surgery
* Who will be going t take responsibility of my eye done surgery over there.
* Who will be going to take responsibility of my time and convenience fare of 90km I have wasted to visit there, as I have also having more options within 30km in my city.

I had chosen this clinic as Google stated this was the second best Ayurvedic clinic for bone health in India and because of my friends living in Bhuvaneshwar who wanted to sponsor my treatment. I had read the many positive reviews but was unfortunate not be able to experience this. This to the price ticket attached to it.

I had arranged my travels from Europe to hear on my consultation day we were unable to afford the treatment fees he had proposed to me. Prior to my travels I had given him a clear description of my multiple issues. Medical history and current issues. I did a small basic course on Ayurveda and understand the way they assess, I mentioned my tree dosa, as well as my feminine changes at current. As a trained physical therapist I understand and can converse in medical terms, which I did - explaining them the multiple issues in doctors language) ...

I believe an estimated fee based on the information given was possible. Also there was no general pricelist of the different treatments (such as abhyanga, shirodhara, ...) as a form of guidance. This means his pricelist is not fixed and he adjusts to his patients, fair enough. I do too adjust my prices to people whom are disadvantaged or understand someone is able to afford more, tho I do not judge from the country they reside. In my case it was my Indian friends whom offered to help as I myself was not able to cover my own healing.

On the initial consultation day, I felt his view was accurate but felt by the interaction with his staff to calculate treatment there was something incorrect happening. My charges for 21 days ayurvedic treatment he estimated at a rate of 120,000IRP. He then took Shirodhara off the treatment and gave me a new fee of 96000IRP.

Upon this, as I understood from my research of clinics in Kerela who are charging less and took hence the advice from two ayurveda friends whom had lived in India for 24 years - both expressed that the fees given where exaggerated.

The doctor had told me his 5 rooms are always occupied - Means he would have roughly an income of 350,000IRP monthly, this is twice more than the average European. He lives in a country were one can survive on 25000IRP monthly ...

I was forced to seek help elsewhere,  drifted from clinic to clinic went to another local clinic. I suffered loss of my travels, my energy, moral and eventually returned to Belgium bankrupt with an additional injury caused during the travels - having to return to work in pain (sometimes not able to walk) causing further strain on my current injuries and troubles I am facing.

Worst during my consultation he mentioned: ""Why you are taking so much tension?""

I felt is was rather poor to make such statement, judgement not knowing the background of the person and why their body had collapsed with multiple injuries, heard of PTSD? And, Perhaps because I took additional risks to come with my last savings to India to get treated, because I trust their health system better than any other in the world.

Yes we do have Ayurvedic treatments in Europe, unfortunately at a costly ticket which I am not able to afford. Hence I come to India for this. At present my doctors want to inject me with silicone and give me plastic things ... I refuse hoping to return to find an honest person willing to help me so I can survive.

Initially the doctor will be very kind to u and once you have crossed 5 months of pregnancy they will show there colours,  All different type of test with no bill will be carried  and money will be taken only in cash.
The doctor is doing time pass, he keeps watching TV day along and treat poor patients with the advice of receptionist (broker)
Please save yourself from going to such butcher","Sanjita Maternity Care & Hospital","6",,,"2.8","1",

They think as if they can scream on people ( emti weight check kariparibani, prescription darkar) everything is provided by the govt. ମୁର୍ଖ ଲୋକମାନଙ୍କୁ ଚାକିରି ଦେଲେ କୋଉ ଦିନ ପବ୍ଲିକ ବାଡେଇବେ ତା ପରେ ଏମାନେ ଜାଣିବେ। They are treating very bad,specially the *head nurse*. Better are those nurses who are standing at the entrance guiding people.","Urban CHC Unit-4","211",,,"4.5","1",
