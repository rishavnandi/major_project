,"0","1898","4.6",,,"Cleanliness is upto date , but canteen food is really disgusting. There's no specific diet for a patient, same food is being provided to all which is very unprofessional. For example, A Kidney failure patient who's restricted to green leafy vegetables is provided spinach in lunch that too in huge amount. There are no such experienced doctors for treatment. Rarely you can find 3-5 only.","Mrinal Mishra","Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar","3"
,"1","1898","4.6",,,"I had an incredibly disappointing experience at this hospital. The staff were unprofessional and unresponsive, leaving me waiting for hours without any updates or assistance. The facilities were poorly maintained and unhygienic, making me question the overall standards of care. The doctors appeared disinterested and rushed through consultations, providing minimal information and showing a lack of empathy. Overall, the service was subpar and left me feeling frustrated and neglected. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone seeking quality medical care.","Snehalata Dash","Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar","1"

,"4","1898","4.6",,,"My experience at this hospital was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I arrived, it was clear that patient care was severely lacking. The reception staff were rude and unhelpful, making me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patient in need. The waiting area was dirty, with stained chairs and a foul smell lingering in the air.

After an excruciatingly long wait, I was finally seen by a doctor who seemed completely disinterested in my condition. The consultation was rushed, and the doctor showed no empathy or concern, barely glancing at my medical history before prescribing medication without any explanation. The nurses were equally indifferent, providing minimal assistance and often ignoring my requests for help.

The facilities were appalling – outdated, unclean, and clearly not maintained to any acceptable standard. I even saw insects crawling in the corners of the room. The overall hygiene was so poor that I was genuinely worried about the risk of infection.

Communication was practically non-existent, with no one bothering to explain my treatment plan or what to expect next. It felt like I was left to fend for myself in a place that should prioritize care and support. This hospital is a disgrace, and I would strongly advise anyone to seek medical attention elsewhere. It's unsafe, unsanitary, and utterly lacking in compassion.","Suraj Kumar Dash","Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar","1"

The staff are well behaved and they serve tremendously and the hospital is also very well equipped and hence it is small (only 60 beds) and 4 stored building. The patient lift and passenger lift are separate also they got staircase and also canteen food is available for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (veg and non-veg!).

,"8","651","4.5",,,"Recently my mother was admitted to this hospital due to dengue and was checked by their medicine doctor. She was admitted to the hospital and was discharged recently. Today we went for the follow up check for which a TPC lab test was required. So I did my lab test at the hospital and to cross check I also did the lab test at an well known outside pathology lab. The lab reports were too different. The TPC reports difference between the hospital and outside lab was around 30000 in which the hospital was lesser. Due to this difference I consulted the doctor but to my surprise he did not even look into the report and threw it. We had waited around 1.5 hrs for his visit. He said the lab reports of the hospital were only correct and others were not so clinically correct and also said that we did not believe him therefore we did the test outside. We only wanted to cross check the reports and we were not satisfied. You all can check other reviews related to the lab reports of this hospital are not so correct all the time, so I would suggest all to cross check the lab reports if you have a doubt.

I would admit that treatment we received while admitted in the hospital  was good but after treatment the behavior was not satisfactory.","Swaraj Behera","Health Village Hospital","1"

I'm suffering from peripheral neuropathy so visited this hospital.

The doctor advised for MRI on the first visit. MRI cost is nearly 10000 rupees in this hospital.
The lady in the reception insisted on giving 5 star rating   in the first visit. She even wanted to help me by taking my phone and giving 5 star rating herself on my behalf.
Another lady insist on taking your prescription for you to the in house medicine store where you won't get any discount.
Visited this hospital twice. Since didn't get any relief from the pain by the medicine so stopped going there. Of course didn't fall in to the trap of doing MRI.

Visited a professor of neurology from SCB medical Cuttack and got recovered in two months just by medicine without MRI.

Review:

We had the privilege of receiving exceptional care from Dr. Satyabrata Dash with our recent visit for Sinusitis Problem, and we are writing this review to express our gratitude and recommend his services to anyone in need of an ENT specialist. Sincere thanks to my brother Raju who introduced us to doctor for the first time and at that very moment we were impressed by his professionalism and dedication to patient well-being.

His deep understanding of the complexities of the ear, nose, and throat, combined with their extensive knowledge of advanced treatment options, made us feel confident that we were in the best hands possible. That made us prepared for Sinus Surgery even though we were scared but the way the treatment was explained, is commendable. The whole process went very smooth

From the initial consultation to the final follow-up, doctor took time to listen attentively to our concerns and provide thorough explanations for each step of the treatment plan.
`
Additionally, the entire staff at Sunshine Hospitals was welcoming, courteous, and efficient.The office environment was clean, modern, and well-equipped, further enhancing the overall experience.

Post surgery the condition is significantly improved and will still continue.

Thank you, doctor for your outstanding care and unwavering commitment to your patients.

,"5","5023","4.3",,,"I had an appointment scheduled for 10 AM online, but upon arrival, I was informed that doctors would not be available until 12 PM. At 12 PM, I was asked to undergo a test, which I promptly did, returning with the report by 1 PM. Since I needed to consult with two doctors, the nursing staff advised me to see the second doctor first. However, by the time I reached the second doctor, he had gone for a one-hour break. When he returned, he told me to consult with the first doctor first.

Despite waiting for another hour, the first doctor, aware that a 72-year-old senior citizen had been waiting since 10 AM, chose to have lunch and returned only at 2 PM. She then took a 40-minute lunch break. By 2:40 PM, we had decided that enough was enough. Throughout this entire time, no one offered us even a cup of water.

I strongly suggest changing the hospital's name from ""CARE HOSPITAL"" to ""WE DON'T CARE HOSPITAL.""

After expressing our frustration, the doctor quickly finished her meal and addressed us. However, she was neither humble nor accepting of the fact that she had made us wait for so long. Instead, she argued with us, questioning if she wasn't allowed to eat. She addressed us for merely 1-2 minutes before we went to see the other doctor, who made us wait another 45 minutes before addressing us in just about 20 seconds. By the time we were done, it was almost 4 PM, and this 72-year-old senior citizen with neuro and ortho issues hadn't eaten anything all day.

The staff seemed clueless about the consultation process, and the appointment system is highly inefficient. If a doctor is scheduled for OT in the morning, why are appointments being offered at 10 AM? Indicate that the doctor will be available at 12 PM or 1 PM, or not at all for that day.

1- Treatment - Nephrology Department is pathetic, please avoid it. They gave 100% wrong report and wrong diagnosis and they said the process cannot be done here (I have written report) and the same process I could do it in another hospital.

2- I was admitted for biopsy - they charged money for dietician consultation. No dietician visited me neither gave any consideration. Upon asking they say it's mandatory charges.

3- If they cannot do the process, they why they admitted me and took money?

4- I was admitted in a semi private room - 3200 per day but they charged 18% GST which is against government rules.

5- Wrong Billing - They bill many items under your name and charge money. If you ask they just delay the billing and make you wait for hours like 3-4 or may be more.

6- If you are an attendant, your life is hell. They make you run from one corner to another. No proper communication.

7- Staff do not have empathy: I heard anything IP coordinator saying - yeh patient railway ru refer heichi, aite toh free re milila aau kete free re nebbo - it means he was referred by railways and he is getting free treatment for many things, how much more he wants? This is the attitude.

9- Their priority is money, not patient health and conditions.

,"10","1197","3.7",,,"My experience at SUM  Hospital was horrendous from start to finish.

Services and Management:
The management was disorganized and indifferent, taking hours to admit our patient  with poor communication and excessive paperwork.

Nursing Staff:
The nurses were rude and unprofessional, often ignoring requests and responding with irritation.

Doctors' Behavior and Attitude:
The doctors were dismissive and arrogant, barely listening to our  concerns and rushing through consultations.

Treatment:
The treatment was careless and substandard.The hospital seemed more interested in charging exorbitant fees than providing proper care.

Ward Conditions:
The ward was filthy, noisy, and chaotic. The bathrooms were rarely cleaned, and the beds were uncomfortable and poorly maintained.

Money Over Care:
The hospital prioritized profit over patient care, with hidden costs and unnecessary procedures at every turn.

Dangerous Discharge Practices:
Our patient  was discharged in poor condition, leading to severe health complications. This reckless practice endangers lives.

Summary:
Incompetent management, rude staff, poor treatment, filthy wards, and a focus on profit over care make SUM Hospital a nightmare.","Diptimayee Kandi","SUM Hospital","1"

I have been visiting to this hospital since 2005 , when ever me or my friends or my family members got sick.

It's the best private medical colleges cum hospital in odisha.

That time hardly 500 patients were visiting. If you go tomorrow you can find 5000 patients at a time or more than that.

It's management continuously increased wide range of health care services.

Best departments are :-
1- Cardiology
2- Cheast & TB
3- General Medicine & Surgery
4- Neurology
5- Endocrinology
6-Hematology
7- Skin & VD
8- COVID care
9- Gastroenterology
10- Urology

Need Improvement:-
1- Nephrology ( kiddny transplant)
2- Gynecology
3- Opthalmology
3- Over all ambience & cleanness.
4- bed availablity
5- canteen meals
6- Dental care
7- Test reports are taking one day time .

As it's a medical colleges it will give a feeling like government hospital but it's quite reasonable for common people.
OPD registration is free. Medicine cost is minimal. But nurses needs to be more caring.

It has dedicated COVID care centre  & blood bank. All clinical tests are cheaper in comparison to others. Parking facility is available.

Dental care is separated from main building.

I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional knee replacement treatment and care I received under your dedicated team's expertise. From the initial consultation to the post-operative recovery, every step of the process was marked by professionalism, compassion, and outstanding medical care.

The orthopedic surgeons Dr Sandeep Singh and their support staff demonstrated an unparalleled level of skill and commitment. Their thorough explanations, attentiveness to my concerns, and the successful execution of the knee replacement surgery.

The nursing staff's unwavering support during my Mom’s recovery played a crucial role in making the rehabilitation process smooth and comfortable. Their patience, empathy, and tireless efforts did not go unnoticed, and I am truly grateful for their exceptional care.

Additionally, the hospital's facilities were conducive to a positive healing environment. The cleanliness, organization, and efficiency of the entire team contributed to an experience that exceeded my expectations.

Please convey my sincere thanks to everyone involved in my Mom’s knee replacement journey. Your commitment to excellence in healthcare has not only restored my mobility but has also left an indelible mark of gratitude on my heart.

Thank you for the outstanding services provided by your hospital, and I will be sure to recommend your institution to others seeking top-notch orthopedic care.

It was really a painless experience for wisdom tooth removal and Root Canal Treatment.  I didn't experienced any minor pain post removal too, thanks to the technique and medicines recommended by Doctors. The treatments are very well planned and doctors are available for support even post treatments for any doubt or concern.

Staring from staff to Doctor all are well cooperative and you will definitely find best assistance and treatment as well. This
is one of the cleanest hospital as well.
Best Doctors are available for assistance and the best treatment is ensured.

When I do my regular Health check up frequently….recently I did the package optima check up it was carried out smoothly from entry to exit.

Mr.Kedar who co ordinates the check up from entry to exit is one of the best person I have ever seen . I thank him and appreciate him the way he executes his job . Just an excellent human being and sincere employee . An Organisation needs this type of employee and human being.

However My complain goes to Dr. Smita satapathy( gynic) who behaved so rudely . She misbehaved to me and my wife while a optima health check up was carried out ( PAP smear) . I did not even went back to her after the reports were received and consulted another Doctor outside. She thinks everyone comes to care is from small village. I would like to clear in this platform that I am a NRI …more qualified then her in my field and holding a top notch position in a 5 billion dollar organisation . If she can behave like this to me and my wife I wonder how she is behaving with other patients and treating them.
I request to the management to talk to her to treat and talk to the patients politely.  The way he behaved with my wife I was even thinking to lodge a complain against her in IMC( Indian medical council). One spoil tomato can spoil the whole basket … Hence management should take action.

Hope I shall get a response on this.
Rest I really appreciate and love they way they care at CARE.

,"1","3380","4.4",,,"My father was alone when he suffered a Cardiac emergency and was brought to Utkal by his colleagues.While I am grateful to Dr Sushant Pradhan and his team for the patient management I would like to share my feedback.I requested Operations for a feedback form meant for the patient NOK but they gave me one meant for the patient instead hence  this platform.
I am a Paediatrician from Pune.
My father was admitted on 3.06.24 and discharged on 10.06.24.
My observations are as follows
1.ICU
a) No designated waiting area/shelter for the patient NOK.
b)There is no  protocol in place for counseling even though there is a counseling room. ICUs that I am aware of usually have twice a day briefing at a particular time either the consultant or duty doctor updating patient's attendant of the condition/management.Here in Utkal they take your number and tell you to wait for them to call.You are called with just ""DAKICHANTI"" you run upstairs anxiously only to be told we have ordered coconut water for the patient please wait for the caterer and pay that's it.Seriously!!!
After waiting for hours 2nd day onwards for ""the call""
I had to approach Operations to meet the doctor and only then came to know of the treating physician being on leave and someone else being the stand in!
c) You are asked to enter ICU bare feet yet saw members of the staff come and go multiple times with shoes on.How hard is it to provide shoe covers or in slippers for a few visitors??
d) During visiting hours one evening witnessed the duty doctor chatting up on handsfree while perusing/writing in the patient case files for a good 10 minutes.Quite audible to me in patient cubicle.It sure wasn't an unavoidable call nor was it discussing any case as I could hear most of it.Not just lack of  civic sense but poor work ethics specially infront of visitors  in ICU/HDU unit.
e) My father was shifted to the ward before discharge after a stay in HDU yet he had an ECG (LA) lead stuck on him till we reached home.Even the central line was removed moments before stepping out of the hospital.They knew of the discharge well in advance yet neither was he explained of his medications nor this central line thing sorted.One nurse midway of explaining medicines calls someone else and asks her to remove the line.Totally chaotic.There weren't many patients so what kept them busy no idea.
2.DOCTORS
I have interacted with 2
Dr Sushant Pradhan: Excellent doctor would highly recommend.
Dr Sanat kumar Sahoo : Epitome of ZERO SOFT SKILLS. Surely AVOID.
3.NURSING
Some of them were outrightly rude.
On efficiency I have already described above.
4.SECURITY STAFF
Extremely Rude almost rowdy especially the person infront of ICU upstairs.He keeps sitting scrolling on you tube shorts even when spoken to.You can  go upstairs only after being cleared by two security people downstairs so why this rowdy behaviour?The whole experience was weird.
4.CANTEEN
UNHYGIENIC
None of the staff had gloves on while actually handling food .They have gloves on only when taking the food trays around for delivery.
The set up is basically a DHABA catering to patients as well as visitors.
5.BILLING AND MANAGEMENT
Polite and helpful staff,provided us with the necessary information and attended to all our queries patiently.Procedure was Swift .
People in Operations were attentive and efficient.
Lastly I would like to say please make more efforts to provide patients and attendants with basic civic courtesies.  Medical faculty both the Doctors and Nurses should explain things properly.""Potassium correction going on"" or ""ventilator re atchi "" should not be allowed as ""update ""
There is no Dietician visit or advice on discharge summary.Just  low fat high fibre diet.
Its a pay for service set up so no one deserves to run around clueless.
Bigger infrastructure and newer equipments aren't going to take you far as every other hospital is offering the same these days.
World class service not in my opinion.
I do hope management takes cognizance of the feedback and looks into the shortcomings.

But am very sorry to say certain things are not upto the mark as Irregular staff response and very casual in attending bed services by some of the nursing staff . which was very much impressive in case of earlier management(AMRI).As had seen  last year while my father was got admitted.
Secondly I didn't like in Manipal then previous Amri is after operation in my next first visit i,e my first visit/ consultation after operation around after 14 days as per discharge summary they had charged me doctor consultation of Rs.800/- and for stitch removal Rs.400/- which shouldn't be charged at least , after taking three lakhs for operation.Top Management should eye upon it.If these little things are not considered it might lost its reputation at Bhubaneswar.
Also I found there were some inexperienced staff in nursing dept during my stay  *while some of them are very good and polite in nature*,
Thirdly the third party engaged over their for providing patient uniform should be improvised during my stay I found dirty dresses twice though they had changed immediately after complaining and concerned dept in charge had assured to check the same and not to occur henceforth .
One dept which was good as before is housekeeping as most of the  old staffs are still continuing.
They have hiked all double & single room accommodation charges from last year by 10 to 15 percent .Above all it is costlier then other nearby reputed hospital at Bhubaneswar.I think it might be the effect of brand/management change.May take some more time to be at par with last AMRI management.

They give you to option book from their Apollo 24x7 app and let you choose your preferred timing for opd consultation. But that's just a marketing gimmick.

Even if you book an appointment, when you reach at hospital first you have to pay consultation fees and collect your receipt, then you have to go for BP, HEIGHT AND WEIGHT check.

After that you have to submit your receipt at doctor's cabin attendant. Then as per their current serial of receipts submitted you will be allowed to see the doctor.

Explaining patients with confidence and strong voice of instructions as well. Saw few nursing staffs working 16 hrs at a stretch. Still never ever grumbled or hesitated to attend patient's requests.

This is V.Uttam Kumar aged 27 who suffered with Severe Covid Pneumonia. To start with, Initially I took home isolation for 10 days, but I don't see any kind of improvement in terms of my health. Finally my family has decided to move me to Bhubaneswar for the medical treatment. But we faced lot of issues to get ICU bed, however we managed to get the ICU bed in ""Health Village hospital"" which is the best hospital I ever seen. I battled my life in ICU with Covid around 28 days but I got one of the best treatment to recover from Covid Pneumonia. After one month i discharged from hospital with no amount of risk. And I am doing absolutely fine now though had a little requirement of oxygen. I sincerely thank to each and every member of Health Village staff for the service you have provided during 1 month treatment. Heartful thanks to all the Doctors and Sisters in the hospital who has given me one of the finest treatment to make me alive again. Special thanks to Dr Shovan sir & Dr Bhabani sir. Without your help and hopes given during my treatment, I wouldn't have alive today with the way I suffered with Covid. Needless to say you have given me an another life with all your efforts. Me and my family Indeed greatful to Health Village team forever. I will recommend to all my friends, relatives and family to visit this best hospital whenever they need any kind of support. Once again a big thanks to each and every member of Health Village team. Kudoss and salute to all of you.. 🙏🙏🙏

Thanks & Regards,

No proper communication at all about the patient /treatment, as an attendant you need to follow up for even getting an update, for getting a test done, for getting the results and even to shift from ICU to normal ward or for discharge. Such a big hospital and with lot of fame but there is nothing systemic. Department doctors won't be visiting ICU on a regular basis and after escalation they used to visit ICU to treat a critical patient. I don't doubt the ability of any doctor, but I beleive this hospital is getting used for the PG students as a case study/pratical perspective. In fact heard from the security guards that it would be better to get treated at Sum ultimate if you can afford. Sum hospital is only good and reliable only for the BSKY card holders.

Then the insurance was approved n mail came to our mail but due to some unknown reason the hospital didn't get the mail so we forwarded the mail n showed everything but still they kept on delaying till 11.pm. I asked for my medication after food but they didn't give that also as they were waiting for the discharge papers n bill .seriously recommend everyone to avoid this place u can get so much better facilities in different hospitals I seriously came here due to the doctor now I am regretting it.

I think there main motive is to intentionally delay the procedure n charge for one more day.","Ankita Biswal","UTKAL HOSPITAL","1"

Review:

I am compelled to share my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Dilip Kumar Kar at Utkal Hospital's Oncology Department. Dr. Kar's expertise, coupled with his profound compassion, has been instrumental in guiding me through one of the most challenging times of my life with unwavering support and hope.

From my very first consultation with Dr. Kar, I was struck by his warmth and genuine concern. He took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and patiently answered all my questions, alleviating many of the fears that accompany a cancer diagnosis. His ability to communicate complex medical information in a manner that was easily understandable was truly remarkable, empowering me to actively participate in my treatment decisions.

Throughout my treatment journey, Dr. Kar demonstrated an unparalleled level of dedication and professionalism. He meticulously tailored my treatment plan to suit my individual needs, leaving no stone unturned in his pursuit of the best possible outcome. His attention to detail and commitment to staying abreast of the latest advancements in oncology instilled confidence in me and my family, knowing that I was in the best possible hands.

What sets Dr. Kar apart, however, is his profound empathy and compassion. He not only treated my physical symptoms but also tended to my emotional well-being, offering words of encouragement and support when I needed them most. His reassuring presence provided solace during moments of uncertainty, reminding me that I was never alone in this journey.
Thanks to Dr. Dilip Kumar Kar sir and the exceptional team at Utkal Hospital, I am now on the path to recovery, filled with gratitude for the compassionate care I received. If you or your loved ones are in need of oncology services, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kar and Utkal Hospital without hesitation. Their commitment to excellence and unwavering compassion truly make them a beacon of hope in the fight against cancer.","Ronit kumar Samal","UTKAL HOSPITAL","5"

,"2","3380","4.4",,,"Very good behaviour of Doctor and nursing staffs  towards patients. All the patients are taken utmost care inside the wards also inside the OT and ICU, being treated within the required time and proper discharging process of patients after recovery is maintained.
Both my parents underwent proper treatment from Dr. Sushant Pradhan sir, Dr. Bijay Mishra sir, Dr. Madhusmita mam, Dr. Gourav Dash, and many more excellent and extremely qualified doctors.
Except for the security personnels, everything is pity fine there. One of the Security personnel Biswa Ranjan thinks himself as the owner of the hospital rather than being the security personnel he should be, making new rules at any particular situation according to him. No proper waiting hall is available for relatives of the patients admitted to OT and ICU. The security personnel send us downstairs and wait there. I explained them multiple times that doctor had advised me to wait outside, he might need several agreements in between the surgery. The doctor made a phone call to call me from downstairs. It is completely unsatisfactory situation where your parents are admitted, doctors might need your agreements and security personnel like Biswa Ranjan are pushing us downstairs. I really feel there is an urgent need of waiting hall outside OT and ICU.","Sitakanta Mohanty","UTKAL HOSPITAL","3"

Total Casualty charges for a small injury is 550 and surgical charges is 341. I will suggest the whole public of Bhubaneswar Don't visit Sparsh Hospital for small dressings. The actual fact 1 Rating is Pharmacy is forcing patients to purchase generic Medicines instead of TBact ointment, When I raised the Pharmacy they replied in Emergency we are providing these ointment, And one stupid lady over the Pharmacy counter arguing very badly, As a customer I don't have right for ethical medicine. How dare to provide generic ointment for my small kid, A small dressings cost is 891- Which is totally profit no cost included because staff prescribed me surgical item when I reached they used all old items and kept it for their own usage, At heart of Bhubaneswar How you people are cheating to educated mass and What is the situation of poor and uneducated people who are visiting this Hospital.

There is no complaint box or any resolution for patients. Don’t go to this hospital by any means if you don’t want to be cheated","kasturi tripathy","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","1"

Apollo Hospital truly lives up to its reputation for excellence in healthcare. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking quality medical care. Thank you, Apollo Hospital, for taking such great care of me!""

,"1","17375","4.7",,,"One of the worst experience I had there in apollo bhubaneswar. Horrible experience.
I am explaining below in details.
1. My father got admitted on 13th July'2024 in emergency due to abdominal pain. Hospital administration kept him admitted for a week without proper diagnosis.  In the mean time billing amount was compounding  like rocket.  No postive response from anyone starting from Nurse to doctor. We admitted there for 7 days. Doctor do visit for 4 days only.  But in billing, they have charged us 12 consultation fees(Rs.1250 each) when I asked in billing section they told. Remaining billing was for their assistant visits) What rubbish!!!! Imagine if doctor's assistant will  only  visit your patient hospital will charge it like full  fee's of doctor itself. It shouldn't happen!!!
2. Whatever the disease will be initially they will  punch you with high price antibiotics and injections ( price of antibioctic and injections will be minimum Rs.5000) if you got admitted for a week, the price of medicine will  shoot up to 2 lakhs approx. &  you won't be able to know whether your patient have consumed these amount of medicines or not.( God knows). Then when you receive final bill. They will charge you additional 10% of medicine bill saying it medicine administation charge. I was surprised when I see this amount,  10% of total medicine bill. (Ex. If your medicine bill is 2lakhs, hospital will charge you 2.2 lakhs) saying it is protocol. ( non sense). 0% discount in medicine.  You will easily get these medicines in half price in normal market.
3. Hospital will provide you worst quality of food in entire bhubaneswar.  Even small nurshing homes are giving good quality of food. When you get your final bill  it will shows you around 10k for a week stay only in food. 10k separate for food services.  ( I was wondering what is food services- hospital says "" ap daily kya khaoge jo puchne ata hey- In simple language- waiter service) Imagine the type of loot there in apollo.
There are many more points I can highlight.
I can suggest if anyone planning to visit apollo bhubaneswar never ever think of it. You can see other options. If you think you have health insurance you will b free from any hassles then forget it. Your health insurance will not sanction the 100% of claim amount.  At the end money will be paid by you.

Thanks for reading
I hope you can understand my point.","smruti sekhar dey","Apollo Hospitals","1"

Such a worst hospital I've ever seen. I went to this hospital on November 19th for the first time.
I was suffering from cough, sneezing, diarrhea and breathing difficulties. On the same day, they gave me a lot of pills and it cost around 800 ruppes. I went home. On the the very next day I become more tired. Next day I had my board exam.
I went to the hospital again. Both the times the security told me to go to the casualty first.
They gave me nebulization and I felt good and also gave me  injection of paracetamol through the cannula. They've taken blood samples for some blood test. And when I went for the billing, I got really shocked. It was around 4500 rupees. I told to cut some of the test which is not nessesary now and then then bill amount become 2850.
And sent me home. When I reached home, I started shivering. I don't know why... I went to the hospital again and they were telling that I am dengue positive. They told me to get admitted in the hospital. I told I'm from another state, I'm studying here and I've my exams from tomorrow. They literally made me panic and I booked flight to my home town.  Because I didn't have any other choice. When I reached my hometown i went to the hospital right away from the airport and it cost me only 600 rupees.
And the report was negative .
And the doctor told me there is dengue antibody present in my body antigen report is negative.. May be I was affected with dengue before. Which means a doctor can easily find that I am not dengue positive now. still I don't know why they give me a wrong report.
Because of that wrong report I lost one year of my degree and I lost around 15k including the flight ticket. Such an irresponsible hospital I've ever seen in my life!!","Aarathi Jose","Sparsh Hospitals & Critical Care Pvt. Ltd.","1"

Positive - Doctors and nursing staff are good.

Discharge experience-
Unnecessarily kept hold of patients in the ward which shows their interest towards heathcare service.

Outstanding due on hospital are not cleared on the day of discharge,  need to follow up a lot to get clear.

Improvements :-
Upon complaining the staff acted really fast. Nursing staff and specially her supervisor (4th floor) - Aarti Sahoo was really kind hearted and addressed our issue patiently. Nurses were also sweet and well spoken (4th floor).
Some staffs have really behaved like family.
Regularly visiting the hospital since 3 years, but now the discharge was a lot faster than it used to be.
Overall process was smooth.

Things that can be improved :-
Cost is high. Should be little less for all sort of people to afford.
Room charges are also too high.
Ambulance service and drivers should be trained to handle patients well.
Patient's food should be cooked well. Chapati are half cooked sometimes.
..

A lot of changes are taking place and really hoping for more positives in future.","Nidhi Sinha","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","5"

we have submitted our insurance card the insurer decline the approval because of the diagnosis.
When we asked some of them were saying it was anxiety, some says BPPV, etc all the statement made stupidly.
And unnecessarily done MRI, CT scans ECho, holter, eeg, tmt
I don't understand when it was ruled out no cardiac issues was there then why cardiac related investigation was done after admission,
When asked why CT thorax said post COVID we are doing, if post COVID then it should be during admission.

Now let's go for the stuffs that needs a significant improvement. The biggest one is the reception and billing department. Even though there are multiple counters, these processes are still taking a huge amount of time. Next is the price.

Imagine riding your bike to the hospital only to find - there's no bike parking. What? You might ask, ""How are bikes not accounted for at a healthcare facility?"" This is a significant drawback that requires immediate attention.
Park at Your Peril under Heavy Sunlight
To make matters worse, the hospital's inadequate parking facilities leave you with no option but to park your vehicle under the scorching sun. But who takes responsibility if your vehicle suffers sun damage? The hospital’s disclaimer that you park your vehicle at your own risk further adds salt to the wound.
So, the question is, ""Why hasn't the hospital made adequate parking or appropriate shade provisions to protect vehicles?""","SUNIL BEHERA","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","1"
,"0","5023","4.3",,,"It was a very distressful moment at the hospital in January when my father was admitted due to a brain stroke. Despite the doctors' efforts during his 10-day stay in the NICU, there was no improvement in his condition. Though he was responding by looking at us , and moving his hand and leg and yes due to the brain stroke he was not able to speak. We were in a hope that he will recover but unfortunately, after a trial period off the ventilator, he had to be put back on it due to his critical condition.

After a week, the doctors recommended a tracheostomy, which we agreed to, even though it meant stopping his medications for two days. However, tragedy struck when shortly after the procedure, my father left us forever during dialysis. It was heart-wrenching, especially considering that his creatinine levels were not alarmingly high.

We were left grappling with questions about the necessity of dialysis given the critical nature of my father's condition. As a common man, we trusted the expertise of the medical team, but now we wonder if it was the right decision. This experience has left us questioning the competence of the doctors Subhranshu Jena ( neurologist) who was treating neuro issues for my father or the doctor who involved in performing dialysis in the critical condition. These facts puts lots of questions on whether we can trust hospitals in similar situations in the future. I

Ultimately, regardless of who is to blame, the fact remains that I lost my father due to what feels like medical negligence. It's been over a month since his passing, but the pain and longing for him persist.","Md Samir Aktar","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","1"

The professional compitance of the onco surgeon Group Captain Deepak Rautray is outstanding. The professional care given during surgery and after surgery has been of very high order. The maintenance and hygiene of the hospital has in superb, inspite of space constraints. The approach shown by the hospital staff and hospitality has been excellent and with a very positive note. I'm sure the hospital will grow strength to strength with regards to professional competent and over all managemental practices. Had the opportunity to visit most of hospital in Bhubaneswar I feel the over all rating in all aspects of management is definitely better than rest of them. Probably the oncology department is the best at Bhubaneswar. The professional care and Treatment provided by this hospital with affordable cost in general is probably the hallmark of success of this hospital. On the day of discharge from the hospital,
I convey my sincere gratitude and thanks for the services provided. I on behalf of my family convey our sincere gratitude and thanks for the services provided to us during the hospitalization. We are highly satisfied and wish the hospital grow stronger in their future endeavors.

They are arguing with each other saying this not my that his duty infront of patients which creates confusion is they are doctors or not. Except Dr. Ghanashyam Biswash all doctors looking and treat like un proffessional. If a patient reach here for critical care, no relevant information is available about doctors who is present or non available and also who is on round. No fixed time for consultation. Doctor whose number is given for planning and information for treatment they're irresponsible, they don't respond and intimate patient about availability of doctors and when the patient should reach hospital. On call received from doctor and hospital I have reached hospital with my patient bearing IPD-22-23-2124, and MRN-220600427 at Bhubaneswar traveling 700 kilometres for review of earlier diagnosis performed by sparsh hospital, but found no doctors available there who called me for review.  I have already informed the doctor about my visit date , which was earlier informed me as ok on WhatsApp but later didn't respond me over my call and WhatsApp chatt.The Onco specialist doctor who referred another doctor it is also not informed me earlier to prepare myself for consult her. she is also remaining absent.Nobody has given any advice what to do On critical case if this type of inconvenience happen then what can a patient do. Very irresponsible doctors are there. Their activities seems to me like the clerks and headckerks of odisha state government departments like working at Tahasil office. However room maintenance and other services are almost ok. Treatment for patients very much unsatisfactory. It's management is not diffrence between any government hospital. It is just like a neat and clean government hospital. However Dr. Sambit kumar Mohanty and Dr. Debasish has helped me during my first time visit but other s found irresponsible. However my nearby  medical College of Koraput is dirty  but you can get better treatment than sparsh hospital Bhubaneswar.

Overall, I had a very positive experience at Apollo Hospitals Bhubaneswar. I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone who is looking for excellent medical care and compassionate service.

Pros:
> Excellent care from nurses and doctors
> Clean and well-maintained facilities
> Prompt and efficient staffs

Cons:
> Limited space for parking
> A bit over priced as compared to other hospitals

Overall:
I would highly recommend Apollo Hospitals Bhubaneswar to anyone who is looking for excellent medical care and compassionate service.","Dibesh Parida","Apollo Hospitals","5"

Pros:-
--------
- Some reputed Dr are available & they are very polite & treat patients very well.
Cons:-
---------
- Waiting time is very high for normal OPD is about 2 hours. Receptionist should given time to patients after discussing with Doctor as Dr time nay vary day to day.
- Oncology waiting time is 5-6 hours which can easily fixed by giving appointment. They will say come around 9 am & Dr willl visit you around 3pm.
- Canteen foods are not good.
- Hospital management should fixed the waiting time issues.

,"2","17375","4.7",,,"Very bad in admission and discharge process.

Admission process- at least waiting time is 6 to 10 hrs. They Donot care how bad your patient condition is. Even there is no sufficient chair to sit, they should need lots of improvement.

Discharge process- if TPA waiting for response or any clarity then hospital staffs are very slow in process to reply and even most is the time they are not available in there desk and replying rudely to the attendant. The process is also takes minimum 8 to 12 hours.

All these can be resolved by taking proper action and response but these people are working like in sleep mode.

Hope management can look into this issue.","Anjan kumar sahoo","Apollo Hospitals","1"

,"2","13546","4.8",,,"The doctors and nurses are very good and well-behaved. However, there seems to be a lack of coordination between the management, patients, and support staff. The administration appears to be mismanaged, despite my efforts to provide feedback, which I'm not confident will be addressed. Being a big and renowned hospital, AMRI should focus on improving their customer service. For instance, the behavior of the support staff is often rude and lacks the expected level of hospitality. They sometimes behave as if they are working in a government office, avoiding eye contact and responding negatively to inquiries. This is unacceptable, especially considering that they are the frontline representatives of the hospital.

I have personally experienced instances where raising my concerns led to immediate but superficial solutions, which I believe is not a sustainable approach. It seems that many others are facing similar issues, and it appears that the staff have become accustomed to this situation. Various incidents during my visits illustrate these points. While I understand that cultural norms may play a role, I believe that proper training for the support staff is crucial for improving the situation. It's important to stop any preferential treatment based on personal connections or other irrelevant factors. For example, I have observed situations where someone arriving later but having a connection with the administrative staff is given priority over others who arrived earlier. Additionally, it is concerning that frontline staff lack proficiency in English, which is especially problematic for a hospital of this caliber.","tapan patra","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","1"

Also, it was seen, the doctor on night duty was tired and not slept and was unable to write instructions properly and it was hard to interpret instructions from his writing. Although, it was mentioned in their register that the blood pressure and diabetes medications were given to him, it was never given by nurses. It was seen, that the ground staff were under pressure and took things personally as the patient was panicked due to starvation. My father is not having teeth can’t take hard food. There was no provision to handle this situation. There was a huge gap in doctor’s instructions vs the implementation by ground staff and it all happened in the ICU room. We are so much disappointed and came out alive due to God’s grace. However, I quote again, the doctor in charge was good, but the way the ground staff handled the situation was horrible.

He did a splendid job when it comes to helping the patient to keep her motivated or pre and post surgery treatments as well. He always encouraged you like a teacher n helps you boost your inner confidence. Do consult Dr. Sandeep Singh for any Orthopaedic related issues.

Care Hospital Services: Overall service is good but there are some flaws when it comes to nursing staff services. They usually cater your requests according to patient needs but sometimes the patient have to just keep on waiting forever for basic things like cleaning wipes, or maybe some basic hygiene conditions n services. Any improvement in this would make it next level service within this hospital.

Yatri's food services: One of the best food services I've found inside hospital premises. Timely services and well behaved staff. However, there's a need to improvise patient's requests in providing certain basic drinks like tea(which often gets served cold and after suggesting them again they take it and warm it up but this has been a mere incidence 2 to 3 times so this needs to be improvised.

""I can't speak highly enough of the exceptional service provided by Ranjan Kumar Naik . From the moment I walked in, he greeted me with a warm smile and a genuine eagerness to assist.
Despite the hectic environment of a hospital, he maintained a calm and professional demeanor throughout.

Their knowledge of hospital procedures and protocols was impressive, as he efficiently guided me through the
registration process. They were patient in answering all my questions, ensuring I understood everything clearly
before moving forward. What stood out most was their compassion and empathy. he recognized the stress
I was under and took the time to reassure me, offering words of comfort that were truly appreciated.
It's rare to encounter someone who combines technical competence with such a caring attitude.

Thanks to Ranjan Kumar Naik, what could have been a daunting experience turned into a smooth and reassuring visit.
They are a credit to your hospital and embody the qualities every healthcare institution should strive for: professionalism,
expertise, and above all, genuine compassion for patients.""

What truly sets Ranjan Kumar Naik apart is his exceptional interpersonal skills.
He consistently goes above and beyond to assist patients, making them feel welcome and supported during their visits.

My mother was not able to walk from age 7months, hip was misplaced. Due to that her another side knee also got damaged and she was not able stand straight or not able to sit down or up. Her right leg was 3+ cm short and knee cup damaged. There was age of 50+ limit that we couldn’t do the operation.

We visited so many doctors starting from Odisha, Andra and Karnataka in last 10 years. No doctor showed as the confidence what we were looking for but on 1st discussion only we got it from Dr Divya Singh Das, Orthopaedic Specialist (Joint replacement) at Sparsh. He promised that he will do both hip and knee operation and my mother will walk. Whatever promises he did, he kept them with carefully, perfectly and with proper responsibilities. He came like god to us and he resolved 63years problem in 7 days. We really admire and respect his way of treatment. He also took care of my mom’s emotions. After operation when we tried to make her stand, she was not ready due to pain but when she saw Dr Divya sir, she stood on her legs. That’s Dr Divvy Sir. His name DIVVYA is really perfect for him. Thanks word is very less for that so we will pray for his great future and pray to god please make so more doctors like him.

Here hospital stuffs specially all nurses, room cleaners, ward boys (Kishor Babu) or girls (Bharati) are so responsible that we don’t have any words. We really thank them for everything.

Of course other doctors who has taken care of other aspects time to time, is great.

3- OPD charge is 500/- each time you visit to consult the doctor.

5-  Atm, cafeteri are available inside the building itself.

Cons :
1- They do every possible test for simple disease or symptoms.They are both time taking and pricey.So don't go there for normal cold n flu.
2- Charges of room for admitted patient is quite high, everybody can't afford that.
3- A pharmacy is there inside the building but most of the times it doesn't have the required medicine , so ultimately you've to go outside to fetch medicine.","Prachismita Nayak","SUM Ultimate Medicare - Best Multispeciality Hospital in Bhubaneswar","4"

8. For us every patient is important and are addressed as per their emergency/turn...One pt and Patient's party should give respect for time spent for other patient 9. Stop coming with tobacco products/pan/gutkha in ur mouths, it's unacceptable...
We r dedicated to give u the right treatment and opinion...
We acknowledge time issues...
We r working hard to shorten the delay time...there r some technical issues...we r taking some steps that will improve ur experiences in our hospital,  but same time u should accept our limitations...
I'm very much hard for the people who don't maintain discipline and create nuisance in the hospital...I hv to do that as it affects our peace of mind and in return affects in managing other patients...that's not pardonable...Sorry for that...
Patients, plz take care and Patient's party learn to accept the new normal of their patient and have Patience while we give u the service...
We ensure right services will be delivered to u but refrain urself to get untoward/inappropriate advantages from us...
Thank U...","GANESH SUBUDHI","Sparsh Hospitals & Critical Care Pvt. Ltd.","5"

1. Very good doctors. Young doctors need to be more patient and listen to patient attentively properly with attention and ampathy. Some start consultation with patient, who barely able to talk. In this case communication gap arises.
2. Nurses are very good and experienced. Ms Garnayak in Gastroenterology deptt. is really a best nurse.

,"0","13546","4.8",,,"We now know it as Manipal Hospital, but many people still remember it as AMRI Hospital, Bhubaneswar, which remains the best hospital in Odisha. My father's treatment was conducted here on October 4, 2015, by Dr. Subodh Das (Urologist), and previously by Dr. Sukanto Das (Nephrologist). For my family and me, this hospital is more than just a medical facility; it is heaven, because we witnessed God-like doctors who saved my father from an extremely critical condition.

Every staff member at this hospital is incredibly polite and dedicated to their duty. They understand our situations and help as much as they can. For those who think this hospital charges exorbitant fees, it's not true. Don't risk your life or your family's life over a little extra money. Compare the services and expenses of any other hospital in your city, and you'll see how much better Manipal Hospital is.

The security, management, doctors, and staff all perform remarkably well. The only drawback is the high cost of prescribed medicines, which can be difficult for a middle-class family to afford, as they often cost more than a month's salary.

,"1","6992","4.7",,,"I am delighted to share a review of my mother's gallbladder surgery, which was a resounding success. Prior to the procedure, my mother experienced debilitating pain and discomfort due to gallstones, impacting her daily life and overall well-being. However, thanks to the expertise of the surgical team (Dr. Satyajit Rath) and the advancements in medical technology, the surgery was performed with precision and care. From the initial consultation to the post-operative care, the medical team provided exceptional support and guidance, alleviating any concerns we had. The surgeon thoroughly explained the procedure and its potential risks, ensuring that my mother felt informed and confident in her decision.

On the day of the surgery, everything proceeded smoothly, and my mother was made comfortable throughout the entire process. The minimally invasive approach significantly reduced recovery time and post-operative pain, allowing my mother to return home sooner than anticipated. The post-operative care instructions provided by the medical team were clear and concise, enabling us to support my mother's recovery effectively.

Now, several weeks post-surgery, my mother is back to her usual self, enjoying activities she once struggled with due to gallbladder issues. The success of the surgery has not only restored my mother's health but also brought immense peace of mind to our family.

In conclusion, I am immensely grateful to the surgical team of Sum Ultimate Medicare for their expertise and compassion throughout my mother's gallbladder surgery journey. Their dedication to excellence has truly transformed my mother's life for the better, and we couldn't be more thankful for the successful outcome.","Rabindra Rg","SUM Ultimate Medicare - Best Multispeciality Hospital in Bhubaneswar","5"

I am a Army person husband of Sanjita Rina Khalko who is being treated under Dr. Unmesh Kumar Jena for Road accident crush injury of hand and leg.
Pt had come in a serious condition with ventilator support with severe infection and  was excellently managed by Dr Jena with prompt surgeries and resuscitation.
The left leg was in a very bad condition where in outside hospital it was told to amputate completely, However with good dressing by Biswajit dresser bhai, regular VAC therapy and timely intervention by Dr Itishree mam and all  team members of  Dear Dr. Jena sir for a fabulous job for saving the limb further.
Once we had decided to take away the patient due to monetary  issues initially before 12 days  but stayed back trusting the hospital and Dr Jena's commitment to heal and save the limbs further. Now she is completely fine, doing well and wound is healing faster and we are getting discharged from the hospital tommorrow.
Now we are happy that we didn't regret our decision to shift to Army Hospital, Kolkata inspite of all  free treatment there.

No monitoring of patients vitals, no record of patients condition, no treatment record they maintained. Patient relative only get's the hospital bill, nothing else .

The OPD services are very good, some improvement requires at Casuality/Emergency service room.

The PRO ,Ms.Sanchayita Mam is very cooprative and really a Jems professional,  Recently my wife admitted  for a operation and  she arranged all things , I am very much thankful to mam.

As, Its a very small area/building,So it's really required a proper area to expand the services.

Some of staffs in TPA desk, requires professional Capacity Building/Trainings for which they can work more efficiently to provide a hassle-free services to patients

,"3","1197","3.7",,,"This hospital is equipped with modern equipments, technologies and laboratories. Sufficient amount of doctors are there for treatment but are not available all round the day. Treatment is up to the mark but for many small cases, they usually refer to do certain types of tests from their laboratories so that they get assure from those reports. Originally, these are all the methods of making handsome amount of money.

Coming to the emergency unit, it is OK.

Coming to the various wards , where patients stay for treatment are equipped with everything possible and are CLEAN.
But if somebody is admitted to any ward they try to stretch the days so that the patient stays for quite many days and so that the hospital makes much money from the patient through medicines and various tests.

Coming to medicines, if the patient is admitted in the hospital, then it is mandatory to buy medicines from their stores present in the ground floor and in the 4th floor.

And the lab tests are to be done there only as per the suggestions of the hospitals.

If medicines are to be bought for an admitted patient , then it is also mandatory to prepay a large amount of sum so that the medicines amount are deducted from that already paid amount.

Hospital staffs ( including doctors, nurses, and room attendants) : Some are hospitable, friendly and also some are impatient .

There is a canteen where everyone can eat and there is also the facility of serving food up to the patients in their respective rooms or wards which have to be prepaid.

It is mandatory that one should be with an indoor patient (may it be from his/her family, or friend) who will do the similar work of an attendant.

Medical students also come here often for their practicals. The students are from their medical college.

Crowdy place 9:00 am onwards.

Parking near the hospital : For two wheeler ,  Rs. 10 is charged . For four wheelers there is no such parking lot or structure avilable right now. You can simply park it near any side of the road. But I heard that a parking lot  is being constructed for this parking problem infront of the hospital.

Please don't get admit if it's not a too much serious case, or they (hospital authorities) will not let you go until they make sufficient money from you.

Apart from these , the difference that it makes from other private hospitals is that the bed charge is not charged from indoor or admitted patients.

It also has an ATM booth of Punjab National Bank inside. Ambulance services are also available.

Tip: What I had experienced , the 'Department of Opthalmology' (where  eye treatment is done) is good.

This is fully air conditioned and offers most of the treatment like Cardiology, Neuro, Orthopaedic, Nephro so on ..It has emergency casuality section setup. However the service provider is not up to par for the price they are charging. Lack of experience staff in ICU and Casuality ward is concerning. Nursing and care giver are young and inexperienced. Room charge is too expensive. Overall experience is not good. Look for other super speciality hospital if you can.

Long time is taken in dealing with Insurance and IPD billing section. Tiering experience.

,"1","1696","4.2",,,"I was for the cancer treatment (Hodgkin lymphoma) almost for a year at Sparsh Hospital.
Initially I was diagnosed in Bangalore in April 2017 when I  had a small lump at the groin area. We thought of taking the treatment in Bhubaneswar as it was our hometown. I remember I was undergone with counseling by Dr. Ghanshyam Biswass. Who gave me support and assurance that the treatment would go smoothly. His healing kind of words gave me courage.
I remember on 3rd may I had my 1st chemo.  Followed by 11 more with in a span of 6-7 months. Followed by radiations and With regular check ups. During these days I came across lots of physical as well as mental or psychological pain which can't be expressed.
But anyways... coming to the service and hospitality, the staff or Nurses at Sparsh were extremely professional, skilled, helpful, give such care like no other hospitals as per my knowledge. They speak like a patient's own family members. That's a great difference I found at Sparsh Hospital. At Sparsh Hospital everything is taken care of whether it may be quality of food, hygiene, or services.
Nutritionist, Rout mam, she guided me with all my food intake as well as with hygiene. A lot to learn from her. Quite informative, and experienced.

So I want to conclude that I am very much satisfied with the attention, care, and treatment which Sparsh Hospital Bhubaneswar provides to the patients.

I will highlight my 14days experience and I lost my mother and she had stone in gall bladder.
-Pathetic service
-11beds inside ICU and hardly 2-3 inexperience nurses to take care all patients
-One doctor in ICU for 12hrs possible passed out from college -doesn’t looks experienced at all
-No experienced surgeons  are working here
-Prime moto of this hospital bring a patient and put him in ICU and it is money-sucking .....
-Staffs starting from reception,insurance,admin...very very unprofessional.
-Only one thing I can say “Don’t admit any one in this hospital and more precisely NO NO NO if you need any surgery/Operation from them”.
-My mother passed away around 10PM and they did’t give me clearance because final settlement was not done as she was covered through insurance.However I requested them “I will submit a check and if there is any difficulty from indurance can deduct from check and simple answer was NO”.Next day morning they started processing file after 11am and I finally got clearance to take the body around 2.30PM.
-They billed nearly 4.5Lakhs .
-I myself feal guilty “She could have cured,if I choose some better facility hospital “.

The sad part is all private hospitals in Bhubaneswar are simple running by advertisement ,free medical camp and by putting few ministers photos with lots of appreciation merely simple lie.Don’t go with fancy words,touts recommendation.
Always take 2nd,3rd experienced doctor’s opinion and then choose best hospital.

In a very rude tone he asked me what do u want and I told him about my father's health history. But he was not in a mood to listen he just keep on saying what do u want then i asked him to suggest something to relieve my father from intense pain he directly denied me saying  ""Doctor Ghanshyam is not  for taking care and giving support, if u want support and care then visit some other hospitals, if u want chemo then come here"".. I was like speechless and with tears in my eyes I walked away.  How could a doctor be so rude to his customer? He could have politely speak to me and atleast could have once checked my reports and then suggest something in a polite manner. Really I dont know why he has so much attitude. But sir if u will come across my review anytime then i just want to say thank you that u denied me ... after u denied only  I visited Amri hospital and had my father's surgery there and Amri doctors are so humble and nice that they cured my father  and now my father is able to eat again ,he has no pain.","Topeswari Bishoyi","Sparsh Hospitals & Critical Care Pvt.

They were incredibly attentive and always available to help, even during the busiest times.

The intresting part is , once patient is in wheel chair, all the travel of wheel chaired patient only by their staffs.
And one more interesting Fact, all discharged patients will be properly cleaned or shaved (if patient wish) and then carried to exit gate by Wheel chair. This is Protocoll.

16thApril2016 due to some innate congestion in my heart. I was readily hospitalized with different precautionary activities. After Angiography ,I was spontaneously judged and medicalised in the I. C. U. By reluctant efforts of the Cardiologists, I felt independent with some follow-up actions and medicines. Under medication, I have been contacting with my honourable dr. Dr. M. K. Tripathy with prior permissions. Sometimes, we are fainted due to delay interactions. Total staff of the preliminary officiating, canteen management, immediate personnels to Doctors, medical testings, ECG/ECHO stand-by representatives with respective radiologists are stupendously praiseworthy. I cannot wave the Care Hospital so far   as the miraculous hospitality is concerned. My sincere experience since 8 years(2016-23) is highly commendable. Other than cardilogy, other faculty captains are similarly beyond teething. The extraordinary personality with alluring  gossips of my esteemed dr.

,"1","5023","4.3",,,"I visited Dr. Debabrata Panigrahi (ENT) specialist today, for checking the ears of my 3 year old daughter.
I would say that Dr, Panigrahi was not really professional enough. Please find below my impressions about the doctor.

1. Behavior: As he seems to be a senior doctor, I expected him to me very polite, and friendly, however, that was not the case.
Also, I don't understand why doctors get offended, when the patients ask questions regarding the medicines. When I asked him about the composition of the medicines he had prescribed, he seemed to get offended.

2. Diagnostic: He just checked both the ears of my daughter,  using a torch for a few seconds, and concluded that it was ear infection, and prescribed some medicines including an antibiotic (amoxycillin), even though there was no sign of any infection, or any liquid deposition in the ear.
When I told him to clean the ear, he avoided it, and told to complete the medication, and come back after a week.
I mean, he being a senior doctor, I expect him to be more proactive in diagnosing the problem, rather than jumping to conclusion.
After coming back home, I checked the ears carefully, and was able to remove a hardened ear wax.
My point is that the doctor had all the required equipments, and he could have easily checked and cleaned the ears, and there would have been no need of the antibiotics prescribed.

So, disappointed this time, as I often visit Dr. Mamata Panda, at Care, and she seems to be a great doctor.","sandeep Kumar","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","3"

,"3","2313","4.6",,,"I would like share my own experience about Sunshine hospital that i hope its only no-1 worst hospital in bhubneswar, i was doing treatment of my father who if brain stroke patients from 8 months, he was well from last 8 months by treatment other hospital but unfortunately due head pain and sleeping issue i visit dr Payod kumar jena, however he asked to diagnose lot of tests like -MRI, blood tests many more then he prescribed the same old medicine and as to visit after 5 days.
My father health not even littile improve after 5 days. Again i came and visit dr payod jena he simply suggested for admission. I did admission but some other dr name Tanmay padhi was doing treatment from 4/5 days but patients health was bad conditions day by day.. When i came to know that the drugs were no changes to his issues.. Simply they were giving paracetamol, gas medicine and hard dose sleeping piles 25 mg and blod pressure drugs which earlier used to.
I requested them kindly let me know what cause.. They simply say be stay here 10/ 15 days then your patient will be improve... Every day we met patient and see his healt conditions is going to bad since there is no good doctor know about nurology i hope..Simply may got a degree. finally i requested to discharge howver very hardly they got agree but took a complete day till evening and they did unnecessary MRI scan again without informing me while no doctors there to see report till night. What a nonsense stafs are there i feel very bad in my life in that hospital.The hospital is only for money purpose seems,  Even i observed other patients situation also same all other patients attendor saying..
After discharged of my fatyer i saw all drugs which they given for five days dose are paracetamol, gas tablets, hard dose 25 mg sleeping pils and blood presure medicine which i used to.

I would recommend never go to that hospital if you realy wants your patients to be well.","Santosh Sahoo","Sunshine Hospital","1"

,"1","1696","4.2",,,"One of the key contributing factors to the compounding growth of “SPARSH HOSPITAL” has been its efficient operational management & meeting people's requirements. The organization under the leadership of DR. DHIR & DR. BISWAS has been successful in building a total solution to all the requirements of there patients. It has been done through forward and backward integration and various processes wherever required by introduction of innovative ideas.
The entire system is presently handled with a military precision and at present not only covers Bhubaneswar but also has plans to support the demand and new ventures across the city  both creating opportunity for all the  individual's and the community without any ambiguity.

In the present day one cannot over emphasize the importance of ""QUALITY HOSPITALS & STAFFS""and DR. DHIR was early in recognizing the importance and putting place the right resources and creating what they have today for all the
individuals. For a person who handles more than several individual hopes with well defined projects and standards complimented by his team member’s has been a major factor in building up the relationship and faith among all of his patients and many more.

It has been Dr. Dhir’s dream to bring the entire concept to a next level where he can help people in every aspect.

“SPARSH HOSPITAL ” which is still evolving has been the major binding force that held the organization during the days of recession when many perished.

The “SPARSH” difference -

It has always been a question that I have wondered during my brain storming sessions as to what makes “SPARSH HOSPITAL” different from the others and I have agreed that it is the “VALUES”. The values that makes them responsible for all that they do and makes them answerable for there  actions. Dr. DHIR put’s this value behind his success and hence have grown from person to have build an empire and survived the rough days with ease.

At-last, I would like to thank DR. Swetaleena parija & DR. Sanjay jangid whom according to me are the pillars of Sparsh who’s effort and deification towards there profession is immense.","Kaushik","Sparsh Hospitals & Critical Care Pvt. Ltd.","5"

,"2","13546","4.8",,,"Recently had my father undergone a stenting procedure.

Worst management and non-medical staffs thought nurses and the doctor were pretty good.
They charged 3.7 lakhs while initial estimate was 2.1 (~ +50 for extra stent). The logic was since we requested to upgrade to a single room for a day post ICU - they doubled the package from 70k to 1.4 lakh. They were clueless on what the package included and kept on fighting that the package is doubled while the single room rent was around 10k and no once told us about the package doubling. Btw OT, ICU, consultation were not part of the packages

Upon continued enquiry from us they concluded that it’s a IT issue and reduced the bill to 2.9 lakh. Imagine how helpless someone can be in this situation - thank god my family and friends were there.

Pathetic and near illegal, just because we had insurance and the audacity of the hospital staff to defend the initial bill.","Abhishek Das","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar","1"

,"2","5023","4.3",,,"Worst doctors and worst experience at Care hospital. Because of Dr Subhranshu Jena and Dr Deepak Parida’s negligence, lack of attention, misdiagnosis our patient died. Do not ever consult them if you want your patient to survive. During our patient’s treatment both of them were on leave the entire time. We paid lakhs of money only to get treatment by nurses who again don’t even know how to interpret basic parameters, or anything about medicine, injections, bed side procedures. They function like robots. We were extremely concerned because we could see our patient was deteriorating in front of our eyes but the so called nurses and critical care doctors waited for more proof. We heavily regret having taken our patient to Care hospital, BBSR. Even the way critical care doctors interacted with us (family members) is unthinkable. They don’t know how to communicate correctly with concerned family members. They would harass and be harsh with my mom and us ( daughters) They never communicated about anything with us(family members) inspite of us asking about our patient’s deteriorating condition numerous times.

Care hospital, Bhubaneswar does not even have a decent neurologist or neurosurgeons. All are incompetent. All they care about is money. It’s a shame to even call that place a hospital.

Never go to Care and specifically to Dr Subhransu Jena or Deepak Parida or Mitalee Kar for any neurology related consultation. They are a shame in name of humanity. It’s a shame they call themselves doctors!","Isha Satyam","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","1"

Very pathetic hispitalization system in Odisha.

Government should make all education and hispitalization free of cost like other developed countries, to stop this business.

Suggest not to go this hospital for cardiology. Better die in home or go to AIMS.

,"1","6992","4.7",,,"Had a nice experience during my dad’s treatment in this hospital.
Pros:
- Excellent ICU facilities. Absolutely top notch.
- Equipped with all modern facilities and instrument’s
- Prompt response from the Nurses across all the departments (ICU, HDU, Cabin)
- Very good house keeping service. Special thanks to Susil Sethi who helped us with all needs. He was very prompt at the time of need and shown a great deal of empathy. Thanks again to him for his brilliant service.
- Neat and clean rooms.
- Rooms being cleaned in regular interval of time.
- Worth to mention the quality of food available at the canteen for the attendants. Reasonable price and very good in taste and healthy as well. Not oily like street foods.
- Food is served for the patients at regular interval of time based on the diet chart prepared by dietician.
- Very good security.
Improvement:
- Definitely not a hospital for everyone considering the price of the treatment. But considering the kind if service they provide the price is worth.
- One thing I observed the overall cost of treatment could be reduced if the insurance amount could be spent little efficiently. I felt lot of extra charges getting applied in insurance which i think is the case of most of the corporate hospitals.
- There is a bit of lack in communication about the condition of patient when the patient is in ICU / HDU. This is definitely an area to be improved so that the relatives or near ones would be assured about the situation and can take informed decisions.","Santosh Kar","SUM Ultimate Medicare - Best Multispeciality Hospital in Bhubaneswar","5"

PROS:
In terms of being a hospital , IMS & SUM is the best in providing super specialist services at affordable prices , with various government and other schemes also valid

Nearly every investigational procedures are available at the institute making it one of the best in the state

Some of the finest and biggest name in the state are employee to the hospital and serve tirelessly to cure the ailments.

As for being an institute , the faculty is one of the finest in state with a potent library , decent infrastructure , and good study structures

CONS:
However patient day to day care can be a bit lagging and sometimes may even be as callous as government colleges in the state

Although this is a private institute the overall behavior of staff and their responses can very well be rude at times , it's not corporate hospital like

Care hospital has a reputation because of its  doctors and most efficient supporting staff. Patient come to the hospital because of their long association with the  hospital and doctors. They have certain expectations in the matter of diagnosis, treatment and care, cost effectiveness, appropriate and quicker service. However still there are certain areas where the above mentioned qualities are yet to be functional. The hospital should take care of innovating skillful implementation of diagnostic perfection of the doctors which is hallmark of any treatment. Moreover Doctors need to be considerate over the financial position of the patient. Support team need to be empathetic to the situation of the patients. The management should look into the matter holistically to ensure hiring more skilled and responsible human resources to deliver appropriate healthcare to all.","Basav Mohapatra","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","3"

She took the time to explain every detail, ensuring we were well-informed and comfortable with the treatment plan. Her timely availability and prompt responses to any concerns were truly commendable. Dr. Hegde's dedication to her patients' well-being is evident in the personalized care she provides, making her an exceptional doctor.

Dr. Ankita Bhagat, our pediatrician, has been equally remarkable. Her warm and friendly demeanor instantly puts children and parents at ease. She is thorough in her examinations and ensures that every aspect of our child's health is addressed. Her timely guidance and availability have been a great source of comfort, especially during emergencies. Dr. Bhagat's genuine care and commitment to her young patients' health and happiness make her an outstanding pediatrician.

,"0","5023","4.3",,,"Dr. Mitali Kar Exceptional Neurologist
I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled to share my experience with Dr. Mitali Kar, a remarkable neurologist. My 74-year-old mother suffered a severe brain stroke, and we rushed her to the nearest government medical college, MKCG. Unfortunately, the emergency doctors there neglected her, and we had no choice but to transfer her to Bhubaneshwar CARE. It was there that we were introduced to Dr. Mitali Kar, and little did I know what a blessing she would turn out to be.
Dr. Mitali took charge of my mother's case within two days of her arrival in the ICU. To my astonishment, my mother was transferred out of the ward after just eight days, and we were able to fly her to Hyderabad for further treatment.

Dr. Mitali is not only an expert in her field, but she also possesses an incredible amount of empathy and kindness. She goes above and beyond to ensure the well-being of her patients. I am grateful for her straightforwardness, as she addresses any issues with the hospital staff, be it related to food timings, hygiene, or any other concerns.

Despite being thousands of miles away in the United States, I am amazed at Dr. Mitali's dedication. Whenever I reach out to her regarding my mother's condition, she responds promptly, usually within five minutes. Her commitment to her patients and willingness to provide guidance and support are truly commendable.

I cannot thank Dr. Mitali enough for all that she has done for my mother's recovery. Although it will take time, I am confident that with Dr. Mitali's exceptional care, my mother is on the path to a successful recovery. She exemplifies the qualities that all doctors should possess – expertise, empathy, and a genuine commitment to their patients' well-being.

I highly recommend Dr. Mitali Kar to anyone in need of a competent and compassionate neurologist. She is a true lifesaver, and I am forever grateful for her exceptional care.","Manaswini Acharya","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","5"

Liked :
-Maintained hygiene
-Spacious room
-Supportive staff - the nurses and other staff were helpful. We specially appreciate Jharana Madam who helped a lot right from child birth to help feeding the baby properly and also gave some good advices on how to handle the new born. We really thank her for taking out some time each day for us even though she was occupied in the OT
-Food was good and eatable

Disliked :
-Room prices were too high - hospitals must look after affordability rather than focusing on business
-Unnecessary additional services were added, for example the dietician service ( we have elders in family to guide us on the diet and therefore this service should not be imposed as a mandatory service to avail)
-Doctor services were quite high considering the fact that they hardly visited each day and even when they visited it was just for few seconds. So the charges should be reduced and made affordable","priyanka lenka","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","3"

,"2","17375","4.7",,,"You can have the worst experience ever. Doctors Don't really care about the patients and all that matters is how much they can get money per patient.  They have time to go for rally and other functions by assigning their work to their juniors. But they don't have time to attend to patients on call or on emergency cases. And Sunday no matter what all the Dr will be on leave, letting the patients to be on it's own.","Swagatika Puhan","Apollo Hospitals","1"
,"0","17375","4.7",,,"I recently visited Apollo Hospital and had the pleasure of being assisted by Ranjan Kumar Naik at the reception. From the moment I arrived, Ranjan's professionalism and warm demeanor stood out. He greeted me with a friendly smile and ensured that I felt welcomed and comfortable.

Ranjan was incredibly efficient in managing the check-in process, which was swift and hassle-free. He demonstrated a deep understanding of the hospital's procedures and was able to answer all my questions with clarity and patience. His attentiveness and willingness to assist were truly commendable.

What impressed me most was Ranjan's empathy and genuine care for the patients and their families. He went above and beyond to accommodate special requests and made sure that everyone received the necessary information and guidance.

Overall, Ranjan Kumar Naik exemplifies the high standards of service that Apollo Hospital is known for. His exceptional customer service skills and dedication to helping others make him an invaluable asset to the hospital. I am grateful for his assistance and highly recommend him to anyone visiting Apollo Hospital.","Rajat Naik","Apollo Hospitals","5"

I recently spent 3 lakhs for a 3-day stay for surgery. Shockingly, there's no free post-surgery consultation for the first visit. They even charge 400 for stitch removal, that took 2-3 minutes. The management says it's because of the transition from AMRI to Manipal, It was there till AMRI but patients who joined under AMRI should still get free consultations. This feels like exploitation.

8. If  we wouldn't have shifted our patients, he would have died.

Seriously they fooled poor patient to stay in their hospital for BSKY insurance card.","SATYAKAM PARIDA","Sunshine Hospital","1"

,"6","6992","4.7",,,"My Observation
1)- Doctor had not seen any report of My patient before OT & my father was taken to OT.
I waited for about 45 mins outside OT, then my patient was taken inside so i came out of there, but after 15 mins received a call from OT that doctor wanted to talk to me. After talking to doctor he said- i hadnot seen your patients report earlier, now i after seeing reports i found some cancerous like thing in MRI, so we should not operate now, lets do a Biopsy 1st then after getting biopsy report we can operate.

I just wonder how could a surgeon decide & take patient inside OT before seeing any diagnosis or reports & cancel OT even after taking patient inside ???
My father is 73 years Old and in this Hot summer He was kept without food & water since 12 AM before OT and at the End moment OT was cancelled

2- OT time was not decided or informed so i went to Nursing station & asked about time, one of the nursing staff was asking me that- is there any OT today ?? Isn't it their Negligence that they don't even knew on 18th OT was there..
3 :- Before any OT procedure PAC must be done but in my fathers case no PAC was done & patient was taken to OT how could it be possible ??

4. In stay of 2 days in Hospital no Doctor visited my patient.
Even If Dr. Priyabrata Das was Busy In Transplant Case his Assistant must have to visit my patient.. Also i didn't see the treating Doctors concern towards my patient, that was very Pathetic.

This was really  a very Bad experience in Sum Ultimate

Other facilities are excellent but the concern doctor and your nursing staffs need be more professional.","Dillip Panigrahi","SUM Ultimate Medicare - Best Multispeciality Hospital in Bhubaneswar","1"

Really didn't expect such incompetence from such a ""Renouned"" Hospital.
Their Manangement is laughable.
They don't even have a schedule system through which you could atleast time your meet with the doc.

Told she is out of danger and everything fine then suddenly at night they called and informed patient bp level is down we need blood at night 2 we arranged blood also from morning her blood pressure is now around 110/20 but still they kept in ventilation and there is no proper medication and precautions taken and no such measure action also not taken and around evening when my brother visit to my mom she was fully swollen and getting bleed then immediately he informed that doctor who ic in charge the check the ecg and the report are negative there is no heart beat at all and they declared my mom as she is no more and when we tried to call Dr unmesh kumar jena he is not picking up out calls the next day they handover body for postmortem when we asked him the reson behind the death he is telling we dont no what a ridiculous responsehe have given such a waste doctor he is never ever go to this hospital my kind request its not a hospital its a jail and worse the hell i lost my mom she is just 48 yrs only i lost my everything because of carelessness of these doctor and their plans towards getting more money they can make this operation long back when infection is spreading they delay or else they didi at that time when patient is not capable of facing  operation just hate this hospital

1. This hospital in no manner looks like a corporate or private hospital, the billing counter ladies are pathetic in terms of their behavior. They try to show us it's your fault that you chose to be sick they way they talk.
2. They don't  allow bookings on app or via website for the doctors stating that they cannot decide on the time taken by him for each patient. Entire hospital knows he takes 30 mins per patient, however they just overbook his appointments.
3. For an OPD appointment given at 10 am the doctor was available at 4 pm. There is a huge waiting time unnecessarily. And the billing guys fake it.

Below are my suggestions for better services:

1- need bath mat to avoid any water inside room.
2- Need canteen availability after 3 pm for lunch.
3- need some snacks availability late night.
4- Arrange more counter to avoid queue during testing.
5-More counter to provide other service after discharge to avoid long duration wait for any additional documentation.

(Subhas Chandra Pujari, Physiotherapist, Manipal Hospital, Bhubaneswar)

I was suffering from awful pain in the joint of my right shoulder. After doctor consultation, the doctor had recommended for physiotherapy.

I started the physiotherapy in Manipal Hospital Bhubaneswar. My sessions were incredibly beneficial over there. My therapist Subhas has immediately made me feel at ease discussing my issues and was able to help identify and dissect the background or root cause to my problems.
I have been very impressed with the progress we have made with my right shoulder over the last couple of days. The improvement is much better than I could have hoped for. Your behaviour towards the patients is very polite and respectful. I would have no hesitation in recommending your services to people in similar circumstances if they ever require physiotherapy.

Thanks a lot Subhas, wishing you all the success and achievements in your life. God bless!

Kindly close the EMERGENCY SERVICES.

From starting security point to pharmacy to billing section every one is sleeping. Are you giving salary for sleeping??  You can check your cctv footage of 12th July 2023 .
Timing between 2-4 am .

2ndly don't think patient are fool .. if I'm not wrong the doctor said to the sister,"" I convinced him for ECG"" .. Are you people playing with the sentiments of common people like us?? ( Jitna test karenge utna Paisa aayega na)

3rdly you can check the entry register , your people are fooling you by erasing patients name with the help of whitner.( Upri paisa income babu bhaiya).

4th point:- when I asked to blthe billing counter man to please explain the bill amount for why I'm paying, he refused to answer me and told  me to ask in emergency ward.( Bhai tu kya bas idhar sone ke liye aaya hai)

5th point:- you can check your cctv footage of pharmacy section. I was literally barking like a dog but she was in her dreams she couldn't hear my voice for straight 5 minutes, afte that she woke up and gave me medicines.( Haan Bhai mufat ka ac chal raha hai so jata hu , kisiko kya hi pata chalega)

NOW COMING TO OPD

The staffs are too polite and friendly to the patient.

The uncle from ultrasound ward is very cooperative.

Dr. Agasti is a good doctor and he is taking proper care of opd patients.

,"11","1372","3.9",,,"This is the worst hospital in Bhubaneswar. The rating I am giving here is because of my past experience. The details I am sharing below

1. Attitude of the doctors/managers
The doctors here have only one goal and that is to extract money by exploiting patients. They dont explain the procedure of surgery neither do they tell about the expenditure. Simply they say that expenditure cant be estimated. After the patient is admitted they will keep him/her unless they find another patient and they keep charging for the bed.
2. Cleanliness and hygiene
The hospital is not at all clean. The rooms are dirty. Even govt hospitals are far better in cleanliness. It is evident that they only want money for which they dont keep adequate no of employees for cleaning. With less staff they want the same work.
3. Skill of doctors
This I cant say about all doctors but the one who operated on my relative was not a skilled one.  After surgery he had to undergo minor surgery again at Kalinga Hospital. Still the problem persisted and now he needs to undergo surgery again.
4. Rooms
Very dirty rooms. There is only one remote for the entire block. Although there are different rooms there are no separate remotes. This caused too much problem. Sometimes the temperature goes down and sometimes goes up and everytime it was required to call the staff who become available after 10minutes after calling 3-4 times.
5. False bills
The doctors visit once everyday and put signature for visiting twice and charge for twice. At one instance he didnt visit even once and still charged for visiting twice. There is no way you can know the exact quantity of medicines and accessories used in any surgery. When I asked this they said that this is our policy. There is no way you can get help.
6. Medicine:
They sell medicine at MRP and don't provide any discount. Most patients go in emergency and they don't have time to go out to buy medicine. They have to spend more for this. This is gentleman's robbery.

Conclusion
This hospital is place where they rob people legally. I am not going there again.","iswar kar","Kalinga Hospital Ltd.","1"

We had booked last 3 slots on Saturday till 4:45pm. We started updating to the hospital reception from 4:13pm onwards saying we will be delayed and will reach by 5pm and they said ok without any hesitation. And we have called them 3times since then,   till 5:00pm..

we reached at 5:01pm and they said ***VERY CASUALLY***, that they couldn't reach to the doctor's  reception desk or couldn't reach to the doctor.

The sad part is the hospital's reception staffs don't bother/care about the patients and their family.

Let me tell you,

It's not just one patient.. there were 3 appointments. They drove all the way from bolangir (345km) and now they have to return back)

It's very sad..

I would expect the management would take necessary action .

Because I don't see there could
be any technical issue in CARE hospital. I am sure the reception desk would have at least doctor's contact details or any sort of medium to send the message across to the doctor's desk.

This happened ""only"" ... because of the reckless and sloppy attitude of the reception staffs towards their duty..  very disappointed.","swarup mohanty","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar | Best Hospital","1"

We went for his consultation. He very clearly made us understood the entire procedure and assured us about the success of his past surgeries.

In 24 hours no one came to clean the washroom, when we specifically asked for, one person came flushed the toilet and said it's cleaned (my mom and I laughed at it for hours, couldn't help 😅).

Let's come to doctors and the charges, they put arbitrary charges on your bill. Oh btw, there is no difference better assistant and a senior doctor because apparently they charge same for both (should I pity the condition of senior doctors or should I pity my own bank balance). Now, here comes the cherry on cake point, if the doctor is called on phone to ask if the patient should be admitted or not, that call will be regarded as a Consulataio call and you will be charged fully for it. When asked, why is it charged twice, I was informed that because 2 calls were made (nope I am not even kidding).

Further, when I wanted to know reports and levels of my parents, the doctor said why do you want to know the levels? What will you do by knowing it. Don't you trust us? Ummm hello....... Right to information about health about my parents?","richa agrawal","UTKAL HOSPITAL","1"

He then treated her so gently and gave proper home exercise regimen which cured her in a short span of time. By following his instructions now my mom is able to do most of her daily activities without feeling any discomfort
He is the first one who comes to my mind always for any problems related to Shoulder. Can’t thank enough to Amri Hospital for having such an  excellent Physiotherapists.

I encourage every one to get all the details , the data of successful surgery , the cost to be incurred before getting admission into this hospital.

,"5","3380","4.4",,,"These two stars only for quality doctor and cleanliness. But management of the hospital is worst, price is very high according to service. For better and affordable service you can choose KIIMS, where you can find doctors round the clock.
Some basic differences between Utkal and KIIMS is below:-
1. During admit a patient Utkal hospital conduct Rapid Antigen test which costs you 700 rupees as well as RTPCR test which costs you 2800 rupees. They don't allow the govt test reports. Where as KIIMS allow the same but in case you don't have COVID report  you can test RTPCR in a price of 400 rupees only.

2. NICU charge of Utkal is 5500 rupees where as in KIIMS it costs you 2000

3. Utkal hospital doesn't provide any discount in medicine bill or don't allow to purchase medicine from outside where as in KIIMS you get 10% discount in every medicine as well as they allow you to purchase from outside.

Intresting thing is before admission Utkal hospital counciling staffs differentiate between Utkal and KIIMS like a manner that there hospital is doing the same what KIIMS does, but that's totally false.

,"5","1372","3.9",,,"Kalinga Hospital is again a third-rate hospital in Bhubaneswar. It's okay only for minor operations for which you get corporate referrals/ funding (if you are a PSU employee) and reimbursement if you have health insurance plans. But there is lot of harassment and wastage of time there. The doctors hardly visit the wards and advise over phone only. In most cases, they never come at all. Worse, the junior doctors (except Dr. Lipee Murmu and a few others), nurses and para-medical staff are grossly incompetent to attend the patients and handle the cases. They can carry out mindless rituals only, like forcibly waking up a patient at 6 pm and giving medicines even when the patient is fast asleep. They are only concerned about finishing their duties and while away rest of the time. There is inordinate delay in everything, even for a glass of water or milk for patients who are on liquid diet. They provide frugal meals but will take away the trays within 10 mins whether you eat or not. The staff partake the meals among themselves. Most of the patients go hungry and the staff don't care about it. Some nurses are ill-mannered and incompetent. They don't even know how to dismantle the support rails of the beds. They don't care to check when the saline is going empty and you have to call them again and again in panic.

The actual doctors who handle the case never turn up. Their third-line assistants come on their behalf after frantic calling. Most of the patients lie in a neglected state. Therefore, most death cases are reported from this hospital. Most of the doctors have a totally indifferent attitude because the are attached with other hospitals and clinics. Notably, psychiatrist Dr. Jayprakash Russel Ravan whose behaviour is too rude, disappointing and shocking. The administration should take note of it. He'll never respond and you'll be forced to leave the hospital for good. He operates over phone only which this is not desirable in psychiatric cases. But when you call him up for some important advice, he'll never respond. He doesn't know the code of conduct and starts talking like a vegetable vendor when you seek advice on how to continue with a prescription. Kalinga Hospital, which claims ""Compassionate Care for All"" should avoid deploying such careless doctors in order to save its reputation. The worst victims of this hospital are those who get admitted in the wards for minor operations sponsored by corporate hoses. This hospital is grossly incompetent to handle any other cases. Many patients have narrated their nightmarish experience in this hospital including death of their kith and kin due to negligence.","Bibhu Prasad Satapathy","Kalinga Hospital Ltd.","1"

,"5","1372","3.9",,,"This hospital is a death trap! I would never wish upon anyone to end up there even if they were lost! The doctors are just interested in sucking your money dry without caring if the patients live or die. The nurses are pretty low on abilities and skill but very high on attitude...they are better suited to butcher shops..I had this unfortunate luck that my father was admitted to this hell hole for UTI(supposedly so) where one Dr.Manas Pradhan(uro) was his doc. Firstly this doc was such a big VIP that he rarely came to visit the patient and even worse he considers it against his principles to explain the patient's condition to us. Another friend of his Dr Sai Kumar Sahoo(nephro) is expert at scaring you with life or death consequences so that you give in to expensive unnecessary procedures...and that's how they suck you dry, mind you at the cost of your patient's health. Once they are through sucking you they will simply say we cant do anything and you can go from here. Dialysis is a business there and people are stuffed like cattle one after the other for it. You are more likely to get more infections in that place than be cured of some. They even stopped medications immediately for my dad when his conditions was deteriorating because we had initiated discharge procedure. We were lucky to get out of that hospital in time. If you value your near and dear ones stay away from there.","Siddharth Behera","Kalinga Hospital Ltd.","1"

ପଇସା ବଡ଼ କଥା ନାହିଁ ଆଜ୍ଞା, ଜୀବନ ବଡ଼
ଭଲ ଜାଗା ରେ ଦେଖନ୍ତୁ, ଠିକ୍ ହୁଅନ୍ତୁ

ଏଠି ଜଣେ ବି ଭଲ ଡାକ୍ତର ନାହାନ୍ତି କହିଲେ ଚଳେ, ଖାଲି ଗର୍ବ ବେଶୀ
ପାଠ ସାଠ ଭଲ ପଢ଼ି କି ନାଁ କେହି କରି ନାହାନ୍ତି

ବହୁତ୍ ବିରାଟ ଭୁଲ ହେଇ ଗଲା କି ମୋ ଆଇ ଙ୍କୁ SUM ଆଣିଲୁ

ଶ୍ରୀ ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ ଆପଣଙ୍କ ମଙ୍ଗଳ କରନ୍ତୁ 🙏","S S","SUM Hospital","1"

As per personal experience AMRI main focus is on billing not on patient health conditions.

Regarding behaviour of medical staff, staff behaviour is very rude and their is no humanity within them.

Those who love their parents so much and if they are in critical health condition,never prefer this hospital as First Priority

Hope things will change in coming days so that other can have the good experiences.

Mmeri mother ko urgent treatment ki jarurat thi fir bhi formality pura karne m time lagaye, fir bolte hai ki hum pehle covid test karenge uske baad decide karenge ki admit karna hai ya nahi . Jab ki hamara refer case tha Vikash bargarh hospital se refer kiya gaya tha. Meri mother 9 hrs travel karke gai thi critical condition mein, waha jane k baad covid positive nikla to night k 10 baje bolte hai ki aap dusre hospital leke jaiye. We are not a local , uss time mujhe or meri family ko kuchh samajh nahi aa raha tha ki kya kare, kaha leke jaye. Amri hospital wale option bhi nahi bataye ki hum kaha leke jaa sakte hai ! Management se bhi baat nahi karne diye or na hi management hamari kisi tarah se koi help kiya. Jab MCL hospital(BRJN)ke CMO pata kiye orhume govt hospital jane k liye bole.Jis time hum apni mother ambulance m shift karne k liye bole to hame strecharko bahar le jane k liye mana kar diya gayagaya. Humne 108 ko call kiya tha wo Amri hospital k andar jane se mana kar diya b'coz 108 Ambulance kisi bhi private property k andar nahi jaa sakta. Amri walon ne humanity bhi nahi dikhai, mere bhaiya ne apni hathon m utha k maa ko 108 Ambulance m rakhe. Amri wale ne meri mother ko shift tak nahi kiya. MCL employee hone k baad humko itna kuchh face karna pada to normal logo k sath ye log kya karte honge. ! Sirf badi bulding bana lene se koi achha hospital nahi ban jata. Management should   do their duties properly. Mai to Amri m kabhi nahi jaungi or na hi kisi ko suggest karungi. Rating m 0 star nahi de paa rahi hu isliye 1 star dena pada taki apna experience share kar saku or review de pau.Emergency department sahi behave nahi karta hai.
Thank u🙏

Hope things will change in coming days so that other can have the good experiences.

All they care about bill how much bill they have to generate before test they are concerned about how much bill they should prepare they don't ask for what diagnosis to run but the bill to generate. You can understand the mindset of people and the most terrifying thing is this kind of mentality in health care . Feeling sorry for everyone visiting there as they don't care how long patients are waiting they will come around 12 only.

,"3","210","3.6",,,"Despite bad reviews I went there for my wife's septoplasty surgery , to my surprise experience was better than Apollo hospital where I had done my surgery few months back.

The doctors and nurses are very cooperative and friendly..even other staffs like Mr Sunil from billing department really helped me a lot for the cashless claim process, literally I had to sign in few forms and he filled all other details .. the total bill was around 47k only whereas in Apollo for the same surgery it was whooping 2L !

Coming to the rooms it was well maintained, clean even better than Apollo.

Maybe hospital services were not good in the past but my experience was really good.. I would to thank my doctor Dr Bulu nahak , because of him the surgery went smooth!🙏

Only con is CT scan is not available in the hospital, you need to visit some other lab for the same ,however despite the rush in the lab there doctor helped to expedite the scanning process..wish it was in-house but the staff politely explained addition of those will cost 5L+ per month which is not profitable for them which I understand completely..I liked their honesty in this matter 🙂

I suggest hospital to improve below things-
Provide handwash,towel and geyser in washroom.
Need to provide a more wider bed for attendant.

Overall thank you all staffs!

They treat patients who pay them instantly. More over a hospital staff says our phones are out of service so a patient can reach them he has to directly go to the hospital in order to get the treatment. Don't ever visit Usthi at all. Even govt. hospitals or block level hospitals will treat you better and you will get well soon. This is a honest feedback from my end. Hope this will save many lives.","Rajesh Patnaik","Usthi Hospital & Research Centre","1"
,"6","210","3.6",,,"If you are looking for a quick review, I would say visit this hospital only if u have deep pockets. It's expensive. If u are admitted, they will drain ur pockets sooner than your phone's battery.

We visited this hospital on 1st Nov,2021 and got my sister admitted for 3 days. U have to pay an upfront advance of 5k for admission which will used be for doctor, nurse services and bed charges only. For medicines and tests, u have to pay separately. The bed charges are okay. ₹1000 for general ward and ₹2500 for a private room which also includes food for patient.

The doctors over here are decent as well but it's expensive in my opinion. There were numerous tests which may have been necessary for diagnosis but every single test is overpriced. The RT-PCR test in KIMS is for ₹400 and u get the result in the same day. The same test here in Usthi is for ₹1000 and we didn't get the result that soon as well. A simple antigen test costs ₹500 which is more than RT-PCR in other hospitals. I will attach the receipts of other tests as well for reference. For a 3 day hospitalisation, we spent around ₹13-14k on tests alone, 8k on admission charges and 3-4k on medicines. Around 25k and the diagnosis was urine infection and calcium deficiency. Not that I wanted my sister to have more diseases but 25k for this is a lot.

They have their own pharmacy where the medicines are sold at MRP and  there is absolutely no discount even though u are buying everything from there.  All of that is still fine but they charge ₹600 for nurse services and ₹800 for doctor consultation every day. ₹600 and ₹800 for an in-patient consultation. This is bizzare. That means if u stay for one day in general ward and don't buy medicines and do tests, u still have to pay ₹2400.

On top of all of this, we had to fight with the management because, they charged the bed for 3 days and doctor consultation for 4 days. Thankfully they refunded us the extra ₹800 deducted as discount. The doctors are decent, the nurses are helpful and the hospital is also kept clean but I'm not visiting this hospital again because it's not affordable. I would rather visit SUM or KIMS. We regularly visit SUM hospital and the expenses are way less.","Ronit Khatua","Usthi Hospital & Research Centre","2"

Finding no other way in 7th Aug 2017,I did the test in another lab and as expected the result became less than 150.
I wrote a email to usthi hospital mentioning that there is a problem in their report and attached all the reports, as I got different measurement in another lab and digital glucometer..... After couple of hours I got a call from the hospital who mentioned that glucometer reading might be wrong and other lab report might be wrong ... They r doing correct test :) , They took Rs 1450 for all the tests and I will have to do it again...
