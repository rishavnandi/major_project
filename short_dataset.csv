4.5,"जितना तक मैं इस हॉस्पिटल जो देख समझ पाई हूँ, उसके अनुसार ये हॉस्पिटल बहुत अच्छा है। ये क्यों अच्छा है  इसको समझने के लिए हमे पहले उन सभी समस्याओं को जानना होगा जिसे हम किसी भी हॉस्पिटल में देखते हैं या झेलते हैं जैसे-

1) डॉक्टर: काफी डॉक्टर रोगी की परेशानी को पूरा सुनते ही नहीं और कुछ का व्यवहार तो काफी खराब होता है। इस हॉस्पिटल में मैंने Dr. Smita Sarangi मैडम को दिखाई जिनका नॉलेज बहुत ही अच्छा है, रोगी की बात को अच्छे से सुनती हैं और समझती हैं। उनका व्यवहार बहुत ही अच्छा है और बहुत ही कॉपरेटिव हैं।

2) हॉस्पिटल का मैनेजमेंट; काफी हॉस्पिटल के स्टॉफ सही से कोपरेट नहीं करते और व्यवहार तो बहुत खराब करते हैं लेकिन इस हॉस्पिटल में स्टॉफ लोगों का व्यवहार मुझे बहुत अच्छा और कोपरेटिव लगा।

3) डॉक्टर को दिखाना: काफी सारे हॉस्पिटल में मैंने देखा है कि अगर फोन करके नंबर लगा लेते हैं या वहाँ जाकर नंबर लगाते हैं तो स्टॉफ लोग उसी नंबर के अनुसार रोगी को डॉक्टर के पास नहीं भेजते हैं। रोगी के पर्चे या फाईल को आगे पीछे कर देते हैं। वो ऐसा इसलिए करते हैं इसके कई कारण हैं जैसे -
A)अपनी ड्यूटी को ईमानदारी से ना करना
B)अपनी जान-पहचान वालों को पहले दिखा देना
C)पैसा लेना- कई जगह होता है कि रोगी से चोरी से कुछ पैसा लेकर उनका फाईल पहले रख देते हैं।

लेकिन मैंने देखा इस हॉस्पिटल में सब कुछ काफी अच्छा और सिस्टेमैटिक है। जिस रोगी का जैसा नंबर होता है उसी के अनुसार दिखाया जाता है। ये बहुत बड़ा मैटर रखता है

4) साफ-सफाई: नॉर्मली ठीक है।

5) बैठने की व्यवस्था: अच्छा है खासकर अलग अलग डॉक्टर को दिखाने वाले लोगों को अलग अलग बैठने की व्यवस्था है जो कि काफी अच्छा है।

Dr. Smita Sarangi मैडम और हॉस्पिटल को बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद",Health Village Hospital

Staffs' behavior is really poor. They don't know what they supposed to do as part of their job... even a small smiley face you won't find when nurses talk...

The hospital looks so barren from outside ,like a concrete jungle!!!I'm sure it is also deserted inside..
There are few trees on the divider but not on either sides of it!!
Under the scorching sun,it makes the passer-bys more miserable!",SUM Hospital
3.7,NICU unit was worse. Maximum nurses in there have really bad behavior. They try to make you listen to them by threatening to thrash their pre mature baby. They try to establish their dominance on the parents. They need to study psychology so that they can treat the already in distress parents well. They are obsessed with filling the record book but don’t do the things written in there in time. The cleaner in there also doesn’t clean properly.,SUM Hospital

No difference with Care Hospital.
Though they charge you almost double than regular consultation fee, its not guaranteed that your number will come ok the same day or the next day.

Before paying the booking fee, they will tell you doctor is available. But after payment you will come to know, whether the doctor is in or gone for rounds or not available for that day.","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

My father had a serious heart condition but they dint seem to care and completely ignored the fact. They sent a junior doctor who dint know anything. Really frustating seeing your near and dear ones suffering. But cant help.
Never go for Dr. Giridhari Jena. If you are going to Care try to get Dr. Mahendra Tripathy. If you are going for simple blockage then go for Dr. Giridhari Jena else please ask for Dr. Mahendra Tripathy for anything serious related to heart.

She was only there for blood transfusion but they diagnosed her with other illnesses. She was admitted there for only 2 days within 2 days the hospital bill was more than 1 lakh, all they did was blood transfusion and tests, no treatments were given.

3.7,"My experience at SUM  Hospital was horrendous from start to finish.

Services and Management:
The management was disorganized and indifferent, taking hours to admit our patient  with poor communication and excessive paperwork.

Nursing Staff:
The nurses were rude and unprofessional, often ignoring requests and responding with irritation.

Doctors' Behavior and Attitude:
The doctors were dismissive and arrogant, barely listening to our  concerns and rushing through consultations.

Treatment:
The treatment was careless and substandard.The hospital seemed more interested in charging exorbitant fees than providing proper care.

Ward Conditions:
The ward was filthy, noisy, and chaotic. The bathrooms were rarely cleaned, and the beds were uncomfortable and poorly maintained.

Money Over Care:
The hospital prioritized profit over patient care, with hidden costs and unnecessary procedures at every turn.

Dangerous Discharge Practices:
Our patient  was discharged in poor condition, leading to severe health complications. This reckless practice endangers lives.

Summary:
Incompetent management, rude staff, poor treatment, filthy wards, and a focus on profit over care make SUM Hospital a nightmare.",SUM Hospital

3.7,The worst hospital you would ever see. Their staff are the most nonsense people. Even the doctors are not so good. They didn't listen to us properly and even their treatment style is worse than the district headquarters of Dhenkanal hospital. If you don't want your patient to have an early death surely never visit there. They only focus on how to get their bills before time. And in return about treatment they don't give a damn about it. If you have a lot of money you can simply just burn it with petrol instead of having a treatment there. They are the most horrible creatures on the planet.,SUM Hospital

3.7,"If you have insurance or want to do treatment through cash(specifically in patient treatment) I would strongly suggest to avoid Sum hospital. Once the patient is admitted you will feel like as if your close ones are getting treated in a government hospital (rural area). No proper communication at all about the patient /treatment, as an attendant you need to follow up for even getting an update, for getting a test done, for getting the results and even to shift from ICU to normal ward or for discharge. Such a big hospital and with lot of fame but there is nothing systemic. Department doctors won't be visiting ICU on a regular basis and after escalation they used to visit ICU to treat a critical patient. I don't doubt the ability of any doctor, but I beleive this hospital is getting used for the PG students as a case study/pratical perspective. In fact heard from the security guards that it would be better to get treated at Sum ultimate if you can afford. Sum hospital is only good and reliable only for the BSKY card holders. This is a genuine review and I have personally experienced the same here. This will be my first and last visit to Sum hospital and will strongly discourage my near and dear ones to avoid this hospital.",SUM Hospital

4.3,"When a patient enters inside a hospital how he feels matters the most . The feeling cures the patient by fifty percent.I really admire and admit that this hospital have this quality. CARE Bhubaneswar i visited many times and my wife was admitted for few days as well.

Staring from staff to Doctor all are well cooperative and you will definitely find best assistance and treatment as well. This
is one of the cleanest hospital as well.
Best Doctors are available for assistance and the best treatment is ensured.

When I do my regular Health check up frequently….recently I did the package optima check up it was carried out smoothly from entry to exit.

Mr.Kedar who co ordinates the check up from entry to exit is one of the best person I have ever seen . I thank him and appreciate him the way he executes his job . Just an excellent human being and sincere employee . An Organisation needs this type of employee and human being.

However My complain goes to Dr. Smita satapathy( gynic) who behaved so rudely . She misbehaved to me and my wife while a optima health check up was carried out ( PAP smear) . I did not even went back to her after the reports were received and consulted another Doctor outside. She thinks everyone comes to care is from small village. I would like to clear in this platform that I am a NRI …more qualified then her in my field and holding a top notch position in a 5 billion dollar organisation . If she can behave like this to me and my wife I wonder how she is behaving with other patients and treating them.
I request to the management to talk to her to treat and talk to the patients politely.  The way he behaved with my wife I was even thinking to lodge a complain against her in IMC( Indian medical council). One spoil tomato can spoil the whole basket … Hence management should take action.

Hope I shall get a response on this.
Rest I really appreciate and love they way they care at CARE.

Thank you","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

I'm suffering from peripheral neuropathy so visited this hospital.

The doctor advised for MRI on the first visit. MRI cost is nearly 10000 rupees in this hospital.
The lady in the reception insisted on giving 5 star rating   in the first visit. She even wanted to help me by taking my phone and giving 5 star rating herself on my behalf.
Another lady insist on taking your prescription for you to the in house medicine store where you won't get any discount.
Visited this hospital twice. Since didn't get any relief from the pain by the medicine so stopped going there. Of course didn't fall in to the trap of doing MRI.

Visited a professor of neurology from SCB medical Cuttack and got recovered in two months just by medicine without MRI.

4.5,"Recently my mother was admitted to this hospital due to dengue and was checked by their medicine doctor. She was admitted to the hospital and was discharged recently. Today we went for the follow up check for which a TPC lab test was required. So I did my lab test at the hospital and to cross check I also did the lab test at an well known outside pathology lab. The lab reports were too different. The TPC reports difference between the hospital and outside lab was around 30000 in which the hospital was lesser. Due to this difference I consulted the doctor but to my surprise he did not even look into the report and threw it. We had waited around 1.5 hrs for his visit. He said the lab reports of the hospital were only correct and others were not so clinically correct and also said that we did not believe him therefore we did the test outside. We only wanted to cross check the reports and we were not satisfied. You all can check other reviews related to the lab reports of this hospital are not so correct all the time, so I would suggest all to cross check the lab reports if you have a doubt.

I would admit that treatment we received while admitted in the hospital  was good but after treatment the behavior was not satisfactory.",Health Village Hospital

A person who is about to die in front of an emergency department is being inspected first whether they are emergency worthy or OPD while also being scolded at for parking near emergency for urgency (not even in the front it was, they are the only intelligent beings out there, rest of us are stupid or what). Man I would love to slap the hell out of such staffs. Moreover if you want to get the services as quickly as possible due to medical urgency, the only way out is either you have to be rich or have political connections . Till then your life would be hanging by a thread. It's a proper business institution. Had the worst experience at sum..thanks to its management, security and other staffs.

4.8,"I had an emergency admission at Manipal hospital Bhubaneswar in recent past ,They had charged me near about Rupees 3 Lakhs for my fracture in my right hand ,though operation cost was  on higher side but Dr was good and operation was done smoothly.
But am very sorry to say certain things are not upto the mark as Irregular staff response and very casual in attending bed services by some of the nursing staff . which was very much impressive in case of earlier management(AMRI).As had seen  last year while my father was got admitted.
Secondly I didn't like in Manipal then previous Amri is after operation in my next first visit i,e my first visit/ consultation after operation around after 14 days as per discharge summary they had charged me doctor consultation of Rs.800/- and for stitch removal Rs.400/- which shouldn't be charged at least , after taking three lakhs for operation.Top Management should eye upon it.If these little things are not considered it might lost its reputation at Bhubaneswar.
Also I found there were some inexperienced staff in nursing dept during my stay  *while some of them are very good and polite in nature*,
Thirdly the third party engaged over their for providing patient uniform should be improvised during my stay I found dirty dresses twice though they had changed immediately after complaining and concerned dept in charge had assured to check the same and not to occur henceforth .
One dept which was good as before is housekeeping as most of the  old staffs are still continuing.
They have hiked all double & single room accommodation charges from last year by 10 to 15 percent .Above all it is costlier then other nearby reputed hospital at Bhubaneswar.I think it might be the effect of brand/management change.May take some more time to be at par with last AMRI management.

No one is available for an emergency. 3 day of medication and continues test but no change in health and only thing doctors say is wait it ll be fine .

3.7,No one should go there. It's a place where peak eastern odisha people gathered named as hospital staff and looted innocent people. I along with my family went there for my sister's treatment. That's our worst mistake ever. The doctor himself don't know the rules and regulations. No staff know it properly. We gave the entire money for some tests they demanded. Gave the samples and some reports need more than 3 to 4 days so we asked them is there any facilities to avail the reports via email or what's app. They gave us a number and said to es these facilities are provided here. And today on the report receiving day they said that we don't provide report in that way. You need to come and collect it. Also the phone number they gave us is useless. Not connecting everytime. I don't know it's a hospital ir a garbage of so called humans. Please anyone don't dgo there for your treatment they only there to torture patients and looted their money.

She took the time to explain every detail, ensuring we were well-informed and comfortable with the treatment plan. Her timely availability and prompt responses to any concerns were truly commendable. Dr. Hegde's dedication to her patients' well-being is evident in the personalized care she provides, making her an exceptional doctor.

She is thorough in her examinations and ensures that every aspect of our child's health is addressed. Her timely guidance and availability have been a great source of comfort, especially during emergencies. Dr. Bhagat's genuine care and commitment to her young patients' health and happiness make her an outstanding pediatrician.

4.7,"This is my experience about bhuvaneshvar Apollo..
Apollo Hospital Bhubaneswar is the best hospital in India, but still there are some shortcomings which can be improved to make it one of the best hospital -:
1) I had booked my annual health checkup package which included urine, and  total of 32 types of tests were included - blood related tests, ultrasound like etc.
2) Time is money of every person because every OPD patient comes to Apollo Hospital thinking that he will be free to go back to his home by 4 pm, currently even by 6.30 pm the patient remains in the hospital waiting for the reports. Keep waiting to see the doctor.
3) In the current practice, after giving the urine sample, the patient is sent for ultrasound, in which the patient takes 2 hours extra because the patient's urine bladder is completely empty, which takes 1.5 hours or more to fill and get ready for the ultrasound scan again.
My suggestion: - My suggestion is that we should get an ultrasound done before giving the urine sample to the patient because it takes 2 hours for any patient to leave the house, register the hospital and do the rest of the formalities, by that time the patient's urine bladder is ready for ultrasound. We can instruct the hospital staff that the patient who is ready for ultrasound should first get the ultrasound done and then collect the urine sample in the box, which will also save the patient's time and the hospital staff will also get relief from the unnecessary crowd that has been seen during the ultrasound.
4) It takes a lot of time to get the test reports of other reports like CT scan,MRI,X ray etc.",Apollo Hospitals

As he was a aged and serious patient they also forgot to give his prescribed injections and Antibiotics on time. After I complained the nurse came to give the injections .
And after discharge , i have a small doubt in the prescription and nebulisation process as they did not described  and advised me  how to take the medicines and nebulisation.

When I called the hospital, Mr. Umesh Ku Jena who called himself the Manager said that I have to arrange my own people to carry the patient. Further, extra money was demanded for carrying the patient and finally the ambulance went back within 10 mins without the patient. When I called the hospital again, Mr. Jena alleged that patient denied to come  which was clearly not the case and even went on to say that you can complain to whosoever you want. The ambulance went back immediately after my conversation with Mr. Jena.
So i was forced to travel and upon reaching the next morning, I admitted the patient.

On casualty section the staffs are very cooperative and thanks to them. But my concern is i have visited for dressing which you have right to charge but doctor consultation I have not asked. Total Casualty charges for a small injury is 550 and surgical charges is 341. I will suggest the whole public of Bhubaneswar Don't visit Sparsh Hospital for small dressings. The actual fact 1 Rating is Pharmacy is forcing patients to purchase generic Medicines instead of TBact ointment, When I raised the Pharmacy they replied in Emergency we are providing these ointment, And one stupid lady over the Pharmacy counter arguing very badly, As a customer I don't have right for ethical medicine. How dare to provide generic ointment for my small kid, A small dressings cost is 891- Which is totally profit no cost included because staff prescribed me surgical item when I reached they used all old items and kept it for their own usage, At heart of Bhubaneswar How you people are cheating to educated mass and What is the situation of poor and uneducated people who are visiting this Hospital. You have got lisence not for only profit but also you have minimum mentality of service. Feeling shame. Date 8th December 2023 check your cctv 6PM - 6.20PM for details enquiry.

3.7,"My personal experience from 2005 to today .

I have been visiting to this hospital since 2005 , when ever me or my friends or my family members got sick.

It's the best private medical colleges cum hospital in odisha.

That time hardly 500 patients were visiting. If you go tomorrow you can find 5000 patients at a time or more than that.

It's management continuously increased wide range of health care services.

Best departments are :-
1- Cardiology
2- Cheast & TB
3- General Medicine & Surgery
4- Neurology
5- Endocrinology
6-Hematology
7- Skin & VD
8- COVID care
9- Gastroenterology
10- Urology

Need Improvement:-
1- Nephrology ( kiddny transplant)
2- Gynecology
3- Opthalmology
3- Over all ambience & cleanness.
4- bed availablity
5- canteen meals
6- Dental care
7- Test reports are taking one day time .

As it's a medical colleges it will give a feeling like government hospital but it's quite reasonable for common people.
OPD registration is free. Medicine cost is minimal. But nurses needs to be more caring.

It has dedicated COVID care centre  & blood bank. All clinical tests are cheaper in comparison to others. Parking facility is available.

Dental care is separated from main building.

Review:

We had the privilege of receiving exceptional care from Dr. Satyabrata Dash with our recent visit for Sinusitis Problem, and we are writing this review to express our gratitude and recommend his services to anyone in need of an ENT specialist. Sincere thanks to my brother Raju who introduced us to doctor for the first time and at that very moment we were impressed by his professionalism and dedication to patient well-being.

His deep understanding of the complexities of the ear, nose, and throat, combined with their extensive knowledge of advanced treatment options, made us feel confident that we were in the best hands possible. That made us prepared for Sinus Surgery even though we were scared but the way the treatment was explained, is commendable. The whole process went very smooth

From the initial consultation to the final follow-up, doctor took time to listen attentively to our concerns and provide thorough explanations for each step of the treatment plan.
`
Additionally, the entire staff at Sunshine Hospitals was welcoming, courteous, and efficient.The office environment was clean, modern, and well-equipped, further enhancing the overall experience.

Post surgery the condition is significantly improved and will still continue.

Thank you, doctor for your outstanding care and unwavering commitment to your patients.

Sincerely,

They need to groom up their staff on how to behave with patients
The doctor instructed me to have 2 pills of pain killer for my stomach ache coz I have a ultrasound next day
The inside medicine staff asked me to buy 1 strip of pain killer instead of two
They denied me to give painkillers late at night
And also one aunty was in the emergency ward suffering from something serious
The doctor asked the ward boys to immediately shift her to the ICU but the ward boy denied saying that my shift is over,why should I shift her?
I was standing right there
I was so shocked
It was really heartbreaking guys!

4.6,"My experience at this hospital was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I arrived, it was clear that patient care was severely lacking. The reception staff were rude and unhelpful, making me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patient in need. The waiting area was dirty, with stained chairs and a foul smell lingering in the air.

After an excruciatingly long wait, I was finally seen by a doctor who seemed completely disinterested in my condition. The consultation was rushed, and the doctor showed no empathy or concern, barely glancing at my medical history before prescribing medication without any explanation. The nurses were equally indifferent, providing minimal assistance and often ignoring my requests for help.

The facilities were appalling – outdated, unclean, and clearly not maintained to any acceptable standard. I even saw insects crawling in the corners of the room. The overall hygiene was so poor that I was genuinely worried about the risk of infection.

Communication was practically non-existent, with no one bothering to explain my treatment plan or what to expect next. It felt like I was left to fend for myself in a place that should prioritize care and support. This hospital is a disgrace, and I would strongly advise anyone to seek medical attention elsewhere. It's unsafe, unsanitary, and utterly lacking in compassion.",Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar
4.6,"I had an incredibly disappointing experience at this hospital. The staff were unprofessional and unresponsive, leaving me waiting for hours without any updates or assistance. The facilities were poorly maintained and unhygienic, making me question the overall standards of care.

Overall, the service was subpar and left me feeling frustrated and neglected. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone seeking quality medical care.",Vivekanand Hospital Bhubaneswar

4.8,"We now know it as Manipal Hospital, but many people still remember it as AMRI Hospital, Bhubaneswar, which remains the best hospital in Odisha. My father's treatment was conducted here on October 4, 2015, by Dr. Subodh Das (Urologist), and previously by Dr. Sukanto Das (Nephrologist). For my family and me, this hospital is more than just a medical facility; it is heaven, because we witnessed God-like doctors who saved my father from an extremely critical condition.

Every staff member at this hospital is incredibly polite and dedicated to their duty. They understand our situations and help as much as they can. For those who think this hospital charges exorbitant fees, it's not true. Don't risk your life or your family's life over a little extra money. Compare the services and expenses of any other hospital in your city, and you'll see how much better Manipal Hospital is.

The security, management, doctors, and staff all perform remarkably well. The only drawback is the high cost of prescribed medicines, which can be difficult for a middle-class family to afford, as they often cost more than a month's salary. However, everything else is highly commendable.","Manipal Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

Before to this we were into different level of treatments, but result was only sadness to our life.
As when we meet the doctors in Health Village there we got the positive thought & vision. Treatment started from the Thairoid  cause, Let me say this was our main problem. Doctors gave us good mentoring and support. We took 22-23 days of treatment cycle and then after we continued the medicines & physical exercises for 3 plus months.
By all the blessing and care, we are happy ….we are blessed with baby boy …on 7th Jan 2022.
Our sincere thanks to Dr. Smita Sarangi Mam for their good mentoring and support… A Great experience and Blessing ….…

My sister in law got admitted on 2nd July at 1.20 am in ICU for her cardiac issues. During admission the billing department gave a  cost breakup of per day charges which was around 19.2 k apart from the medicines and few other charges.

She will get discharged some time now around 6pm.

When I went for the final settlement of bill they gave me a bill of 45 k. When I went through the summary I found they have smartly added  many overheads.over my discussion  I found they are well trained to answer smartly with all of their mischievous things.

They are simply cheating people. Every citizen of india must come out of street and give their best to bring transperancy.

Government and the controlling authority must do alot of work to streamline this sector.

Like me millions of indian are getting cheated and looted .","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

There was no any counselling, no information from hospital insurance team. As a result I have to pay 1,13000 at tha time of discharge. And my approval was cancelled. This is completely for negligence of staff. Also I pay 1 day extra bed charge due to negligence of ward secretary. Madam advice discharge at 11am but my file was not ready till 3:30 pm. Is this the way to work. Apart from this all the services was very nice,. But think if someone admitted in insurance, but at the end time she/he had to pay 113000, how disgusting is this. Never want to visit here also never recommended any one. Poor counselling . And I am harrased completely after this mentally .

The former management was far better, this manipal management is the worst. I will reffer my friends and known people to the doctors but not to this hospital.

4.2,Security behaviour vary bad,Neelachal Hospital Pvt Ltd
4.2,"One of the worst hospitals I've ever visited. The staffs are so so unprofessional. There behaviour towards the patient is so pathetic and rude. One of the lady doctor was there, who instead of taking some actions or calm the situations, was constantly mocking and making fun of a very serious situation.
My grandmother who is a 70 year old day, have various types of complications. Getting her viens for injection is a very difficult task, so it should be done in one shot. But the unqualified doctors injected many places that made her hands swell into black areas. Still they were making issues and not taking any kind of responsibilty., rather were behaving so badly that I can't even imagine. The sanitation is so poor. The services are the poorest. I'll request you all that please don't visit this hospital. The locality is too bad. If you really want to save your life, then please don't go here.",Neelachal Hospital Pvt Ltd

4.5,"Dear Health Village Team,
This is V.Uttam Kumar aged 27 who suffered with Severe Covid Pneumonia. To start with, Initially I took home isolation for 10 days, but I don't see any kind of improvement in terms of my health. Finally my family has decided to move me to Bhubaneswar for the medical treatment. But we faced lot of issues to get ICU bed, however we managed to get the ICU bed in ""Health Village hospital"" which is the best hospital I ever seen. I battled my life in ICU with Covid around 28 days but I got one of the best treatment to recover from Covid Pneumonia. After one month i discharged from hospital with no amount of risk. And I am doing absolutely fine now though had a little requirement of oxygen. I sincerely thank to each and every member of Health Village staff for the service you have provided during 1 month treatment. Heartful thanks to all the Doctors and Sisters in the hospital who has given me one of the finest treatment to make me alive again. Special thanks to Dr Shovan sir & Dr Bhabani sir. Without your help and hopes given during my treatment, I wouldn't have alive today with the way I suffered with Covid. Needless to say you have given me an another life with all your efforts. Me and my family Indeed greatful to Health Village team forever. I will recommend to all my friends, relatives and family to visit this best hospital whenever they need any kind of support. Once again a big thanks to each and every member of Health Village team. Kudoss and salute to all of you..

The staff is cheerful and cooperative (for the most part) and despite their lacklustre management information systems, they get the work done relatively quickly.

If you want to meet the doctor then come and wait for as many as hours it will take and cut the phone immediately. If anyone from Kalinga Hospital is reading this comment please find such staffs who degrading the image of your hospital and tell them at least talk to patients with politeness.

The hospital may be small and not-so-jazzy, but the patience and committement with which the Doctors and nurses work here is just unbelievable. Doctors visit thrice a day. Explaining patients with confidence and strong voice of instructions as well. Saw few nursing staffs working 16 hrs at a stretch. Still never ever grumbled or hesitated to attend patient's requests. We were being treated by Dr. Shovan Rath, Dr. Bhawani and few others who frequently visited and stood like a pillar of confidence and assurance by my side, while I was in ICU. Even their OPD manager Mr. Alok was also very cordial and cooperative. Mr. Panda of the insurance desk goes all out, to assist the patients for their claim related matters. I wondered, when did they take rest, because I kept seeing them every now and then.
I sincerely wish them all success and shall remain grateful for bringing me out of the conditions of Covid.",Health Village Hospital

Patient care is upmost for the Hospital.
I at most liked the service and facilities.
The intresting part is , once patient is in wheel chair, all the travel of wheel chaired patient only by their staffs.
And one more interesting Fact, all discharged patients will be properly cleaned or shaved (if patient wish) and then carried to exit gate by Wheel chair. This is Protocoll.

At care we got very much support from Dr.Prashant Patil & his secretary Miss Mamata and Dr.Mahendra Tripathi & his secretary Mr.Satya.
Dr patil described our case very good to us and told ASD device closure can be attempted and we decided to go through on 31st of may. Finaly on May 31st ,my wife admitted and successfully done her ASD device closure. At Ot,Hdu she got good care and support.
On the next day she got discharged due to her stability. The overall billing , insurance & discharge process great. Due to clean and clear billing only 4000 was deducted by TPA at final billing of 1.86 lakh where as at Apollo hospital 12000 was deducted by TPA in a billing of 84000.

I got very wrong feedbacks about Care hospital but in my case with god's grace & blessings from lord Lingaraj,Kedar gauri & Jagannath bhagwan I got successful in my wife's surgery.Now she is doing well after 4 days of surgery.I for good support from the insurance & billing department.","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

4.7,"Initially I was not willing to write the but if I don't raise my voice then this hospital will continue to fool people irrespective of the background.

1- Treatment - Nephrology Department is pathetic, please avoid it. They gave 100% wrong report and wrong diagnosis and they said the process cannot be done here (I have written report) and the same process I could do it in another hospital.

2- I was admitted for biopsy - they charged money for dietician consultation. No dietician visited me neither gave any consideration. Upon asking they say it's mandatory charges.

3- If they cannot do the process, they why they admitted me and took money?

4- I was admitted in a semi private room - 3200 per day but they charged 18% GST which is against government rules.

5- Wrong Billing - They bill many items under your name and charge money. If you ask they just delay the billing and make you wait for hours like 3-4 or may be more.

6- If you are an attendant, your life is hell. They make you run from one corner to another. No proper communication.

7- Staff do not have empathy: I heard anything IP coordinator saying - yeh patient railway ru refer heichi, aite toh free re milila aau kete free re nebbo - it means he was referred by railways and he is getting free treatment for many things, how much more he wants? This is the attitude.

8- You will find tobacco all over the washrooms and places.

9- Their priority is money, not patient health and conditions.

All the points I said, I have proof and I can prove in the court also, don't think that this is a fake review.

4.3,"I had an appointment scheduled for 10 AM online, but upon arrival, I was informed that doctors would not be available until 12 PM. At 12 PM, I was asked to undergo a test, which I promptly did, returning with the report by 1 PM. Since I needed to consult with two doctors, the nursing staff advised me to see the second doctor first. However, by the time I reached the second doctor, he had gone for a one-hour break. When he returned, he told me to consult with the first doctor first.

Despite waiting for another hour, the first doctor, aware that a 72-year-old senior citizen had been waiting since 10 AM, chose to have lunch and returned only at 2 PM. She then took a 40-minute lunch break. By 2:40 PM, we had decided that enough was enough. Throughout this entire time, no one offered us even a cup of water.

I strongly suggest changing the hospital's name from ""CARE HOSPITAL"" to ""WE DON'T CARE HOSPITAL.""

After expressing our frustration, the doctor quickly finished her meal and addressed us. However, she was neither humble nor accepting of the fact that she had made us wait for so long. Instead, she argued with us, questioning if she wasn't allowed to eat. She addressed us for merely 1-2 minutes before we went to see the other doctor, who made us wait another 45 minutes before addressing us in just about 20 seconds. By the time we were done, it was almost 4 PM, and this 72-year-old senior citizen with neuro and ortho issues hadn't eaten anything all day.

The staff seemed clueless about the consultation process, and the appointment system is highly inefficient. If a doctor is scheduled for OT in the morning, why are appointments being offered at 10 AM? Indicate that the doctor will be available at 12 PM or 1 PM, or not at all for that day.

I can assist you in changing your hospital's name from ""CARE HOSPITAL"" to ""WE DON'T CARE HOSPITAL.""","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

Anyways get admitted, even Dr. Mitali kar was unable diagnosis the proper cause,
we have submitted our insurance card the insurer decline the approval because of the diagnosis.
When we asked some of them were saying it was anxiety, some says BPPV, etc all the statement made stupidly.
And unnecessarily done MRI, CT scans ECho, holter, eeg, tmt
I don't understand when it was ruled out no cardiac issues was there then why cardiac related investigation was done after admission,
When asked why CT thorax said post COVID we are doing, if post COVID then it should be during admission.
Forcefully charged 1 lakh.

In between one of my friends parent also came for health check up by self driving and went for the health check up what they did God knows from health check up to ICU and then he passed away matter of last Tuesday shocked.
