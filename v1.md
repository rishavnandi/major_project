# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Hospital Reviews Using RoBERTa

## 1. Problem Specification (100 words)

This project aims to develop an aspect-based sentiment analysis model for analyzing hospital reviews scraped from Google Maps and other free sources. We will use the RoBERTa model to extract fine-grained sentiment towards individual aspects such as service, food, staff, facilities, and hygiene. The challenge is to effectively identify these relevant aspects in hospital reviews, determine sentiment polarity for each aspect using RoBERTa, and aggregate this multi-dimensional sentiment information to generate an overall score. This score will then be compared with the hospital's existing rating as a method of cross-validation. The goal is to provide a more nuanced understanding of patient satisfaction across various aspects of hospital care.

## 2. Introduction (300-400 words)

In the healthcare industry, patient feedback has become increasingly important for improving service quality and patient satisfaction. Online platforms like Google Maps now serve as rich sources of user-generated reviews for hospitals and healthcare facilities. However, the star rating system often used on these platforms provides only a general overview of patient satisfaction, failing to capture the nuanced opinions patients may have about specific aspects of their hospital experience.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to extract fine-grained opinions about particular aspects or features from user-generated text. By applying ABSA to hospital reviews, we can build a more comprehensive understanding of patient experiences across various dimensions such as medical care, staff behavior, facilities, food quality, and hygiene.

Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly pre-trained language models like RoBERTa, have significantly improved the accuracy of sentiment analysis. RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach, has shown strong performance across various NLP tasks, making it a suitable choice for our ABSA task on hospital reviews.

Our project will focus on the following key areas:

1. Data collection and preprocessing: Scraping hospital reviews from Google Maps and other free sources, cleaning the data, and preparing it for analysis.
2. Aspect identification: Defining and extracting relevant aspects specific to hospital reviews (e.g., service, food, staff, facilities, hygiene).
3. Sentiment analysis: Using RoBERTa to determine sentiment polarity for each identified aspect.
4. Score aggregation: Combining the aspect-level sentiments into an overall score for each hospital.
5. Validation: Comparing our generated overall scores with the existing hospital ratings to cross-check the validity of our approach.

By developing this more nuanced model of patient sentiment, we aim to provide a detailed breakdown of hospital performance across various aspects. This can help identify specific areas for improvement, offer more comprehensive information to potential patients, and potentially highlight discrepancies between overall ratings and aspect-specific sentiments.

## 3. Literature Survey (500-600 words)

Aspect-based sentiment analysis has been an active area of research in natural language processing, with recent applications in the healthcare domain. The evolution of ABSA techniques, from early lexicon-based approaches to advanced deep learning models, has significantly improved our ability to extract nuanced sentiments from text.

Early ABSA approaches, such as the work by Hu and Liu (2004), relied on frequent noun phrases to identify aspects and used lexicon-based methods for sentiment classification. In the healthcare context, Doing-Harris et al. (2017) applied similar techniques to patient comments, identifying aspects such as care quality, interpersonal manner, and technical competence.

The advent of deep learning brought significant improvements to ABSA tasks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and attention mechanisms became popular for their ability to capture long-range dependencies and focus on relevant parts of the input. Tang et al. (2016) introduced an LSTM-based model that jointly performs aspect extraction and sentiment classification, while Wang et al. (2016) proposed an attention-based LSTM to focus on aspect-relevant parts of the sentence.

More recently, pre-trained language models have set new benchmarks in various NLP tasks, including ABSA. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Devlin et al. (2019) marked a significant milestone, demonstrating the power of bidirectional pre-training and attention mechanisms. RoBERTa, introduced by Liu et al. (2019), further improved upon BERT by modifying key hyperparameters and training with larger mini-batches and more data.

In the context of ABSA, Sun et al. (2019) proposed a BERT-based model that constructs auxiliary sentences to convert ABSA to a sentence-pair classification task. Xu et al. (2019) fine-tuned BERT for aspect-based sentiment classification, outperforming LSTM-based models. These studies demonstrate the potential of using pre-trained models like RoBERTa for our hospital review analysis task.

In the healthcare domain specifically, Gao et al. (2019) utilized BERT for aspect-based sentiment analysis of drug reviews, showing improved performance over traditional machine learning methods. Their work highlights the potential of transfer learning from large pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks in healthcare.

For hospital reviews, Ranard et al. (2016) analyzed the content of hospital reviews on Yelp, identifying key themes and their correlation with hospital quality metrics. While not strictly an ABSA approach, their work underscores the value of mining online reviews for insights into patient experiences.

Our work builds upon these advances, particularly leveraging the power of RoBERTa for sentiment analysis. We aim to adapt this pre-trained model to the specific vocabulary and context of hospital reviews, focusing on relevant aspects such as service, food, staff, facilities, and hygiene. 

The novelty of our approach lies in:
1. Applying RoBERTa to the specific domain of hospital reviews for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
2. Developing a method to aggregate aspect-level sentiments into an overall score that can be compared with existing hospital ratings.
3. Creating a pipeline that combines web scraping, data preprocessing, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and score validation in a comprehensive system for analyzing hospital reviews.

By leveraging the power of RoBERTa and focusing on specific, relevant aspects of hospital care, we aim to create a more nuanced and accurate representation of patient satisfaction than what is currently available through simple star ratings.

Our proposed solution consists of the following key components:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Scraping hospital reviews from Google Maps and other free sources
   - Text cleaning and normalization
   - Handling of medical terminology and abbreviations

2. Aspect Identification
   - Definition of relevant aspects (service, food, staff, facilities, hygiene)
   - Extraction of aspect-related sentences or phrases from reviews

3. RoBERTa-based Sentiment Analysis
   - Fine-tuning RoBERTa on a small subset of labeled hospital reviews (if available)
   - Sentiment classification for each identified aspect using RoBERTa

4. Score Aggregation
   - Combining aspect-level sentiments into an overall score for each hospital
   - Weighting of aspects based on frequency and importance

5. Validation and Analysis
   - Comparison of generated overall scores with existing hospital ratings
   - Analysis of discrepancies and insights generation

The system will take as input the scraped reviews and output aspect-level sentiment scores, an overall calculated score, and a comparison with the existing hospital rating.

## 5. Results and Discussion

[To be completed after implementation and experiments]

We will evaluate our proposed model on the collected dataset of hospital reviews. Key metrics will include:

- Sentiment classification accuracy for each aspect
- Correlation between our generated overall scores and existing hospital ratings
- Qualitative analysis of aspect-level insights

We expect our model to provide more detailed feedback compared to overall ratings alone. The aspect-based analysis should reveal specific strengths and weaknesses of each hospital, potentially highlighting areas where the overall rating may be misleading.

Potential challenges and areas for future work include:
- Improving aspect extraction techniques
- Fine-tuning RoBERTa specifically for the healthcare domain
- Developing more sophisticated aggregation methods for the overall score
- Incorporating multi-lingual reviews for hospitals in diverse communities

Overall, this work aims to demonstrate the potential of applying RoBERTa-based aspect sentiment analysis to hospital reviews, providing valuable insights for both healthcare providers and patients.
