4.5,"जितना तक मैं इस हॉस्पिटल जो देख समझ पाई हूँ, उसके अनुसार ये हॉस्पिटल बहुत अच्छा है। ये क्यों अच्छा है  इसको समझने के लिए हमे पहले उन सभी समस्याओं को जानना होगा जिसे हम किसी भी हॉस्पिटल में देखते हैं या झेलते हैं जैसे-

1) डॉक्टर: काफी डॉक्टर रोगी की परेशानी को पूरा सुनते ही नहीं और कुछ का व्यवहार तो काफी खराब होता है। इस हॉस्पिटल में मैंने Dr. Smita Sarangi मैडम को दिखाई जिनका नॉलेज बहुत ही अच्छा है, रोगी की बात को अच्छे से सुनती हैं और समझती हैं। उनका व्यवहार बहुत ही अच्छा है और बहुत ही कॉपरेटिव हैं।

2) हॉस्पिटल का मैनेजमेंट; काफी हॉस्पिटल के स्टॉफ सही से कोपरेट नहीं करते और व्यवहार तो बहुत खराब करते हैं लेकिन इस हॉस्पिटल में स्टॉफ लोगों का व्यवहार मुझे बहुत अच्छा और कोपरेटिव लगा।

3) डॉक्टर को दिखाना: काफी सारे हॉस्पिटल में मैंने देखा है कि अगर फोन करके नंबर लगा लेते हैं या वहाँ जाकर नंबर लगाते हैं तो स्टॉफ लोग उसी नंबर के अनुसार रोगी को डॉक्टर के पास नहीं भेजते हैं। रोगी के पर्चे या फाईल को आगे पीछे कर देते हैं। वो ऐसा इसलिए करते हैं इसके कई कारण हैं जैसे -
A)अपनी ड्यूटी को ईमानदारी से ना करना
B)अपनी जान-पहचान वालों को पहले दिखा देना
C)पैसा लेना- कई जगह होता है कि रोगी से चोरी से कुछ पैसा लेकर उनका फाईल पहले रख देते हैं।

लेकिन मैंने देखा इस हॉस्पिटल में सब कुछ काफी अच्छा और सिस्टेमैटिक है। जिस रोगी का जैसा नंबर होता है उसी के अनुसार दिखाया जाता है। ये बहुत बड़ा मैटर रखता है

4) साफ-सफाई: नॉर्मली ठीक है।

5) बैठने की व्यवस्था: अच्छा है खासकर अलग अलग डॉक्टर को दिखाने वाले लोगों को अलग अलग बैठने की व्यवस्था है जो कि काफी अच्छा है।

Dr. Smita Sarangi मैडम और हॉस्पिटल को बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद",Health Village Hospital

Staffs' behavior is really poor. They don't know what they supposed to do as part of their job... even a small smiley face you won't find when nurses talk...

3.7,"Seeing all your reviews I had given 1 star,
My primary concern is if you have such a big campus why can't you plant shade giving trees along the boundary when you have such a long portion of it along the road..
The hospital looks so barren from outside ,like a concrete jungle!!!I'm sure it is also deserted inside..
There are few trees on the divider but not on either sides of it!!
Under the scorching sun,it makes the passer-bys more miserable!",SUM Hospital
3.7,NICU unit was worse. Maximum nurses in there have really bad behavior. They try to make you listen to them by threatening to thrash their pre mature baby. They try to establish their dominance on the parents. They need to study psychology so that they can treat the already in distress parents well. They are obsessed with filling the record book but don’t do the things written in there in time. The cleaner in there also doesn’t clean properly.,SUM Hospital

No difference with Care Hospital.
Though they charge you almost double than regular consultation fee, its not guaranteed that your number will come ok the same day or the next day.

Before paying the booking fee, they will tell you doctor is available. But after payment you will come to know, whether the doctor is in or gone for rounds or not available for that day.","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

My father had a serious heart condition but they dint seem to care and completely ignored the fact. They sent a junior doctor who dint know anything. Really frustating seeing your near and dear ones suffering. But cant help.
Never go for Dr. Giridhari Jena. If you are going to Care try to get Dr. Mahendra Tripathy. If you are going for simple blockage then go for Dr. Giridhari Jena else please ask for Dr. Mahendra Tripathy for anything serious related to heart.
At the end, everything is business. So be responsible yourself first. And think wisely.","CARE Hospitals, Bhubaneswar"

She was only there for blood transfusion but they diagnosed her with other illnesses. She was admitted there for only 2 days within 2 days the hospital bill was more than 1 lakh, all they did was blood transfusion and tests, no treatments were given.

3.7,"My experience at SUM  Hospital was horrendous from start to finish.

Services and Management:
The management was disorganized and indifferent, taking hours to admit our patient  with poor communication and excessive paperwork.

Nursing Staff:
The nurses were rude and unprofessional, often ignoring requests and responding with irritation.

Doctors' Behavior and Attitude:
The doctors were dismissive and arrogant, barely listening to our  concerns and rushing through consultations.

Treatment:
The treatment was careless and substandard.The hospital seemed more interested in charging exorbitant fees than providing proper care.

Ward Conditions:
The ward was filthy, noisy, and chaotic. The bathrooms were rarely cleaned, and the beds were uncomfortable and poorly maintained.

Money Over Care:
The hospital prioritized profit over patient care, with hidden costs and unnecessary procedures at every turn.

Dangerous Discharge Practices:
Our patient  was discharged in poor condition, leading to severe health complications. This reckless practice endangers lives.

Summary:
Incompetent management, rude staff, poor treatment, filthy wards, and a focus on profit over care make SUM Hospital a nightmare.",SUM Hospital

3.7,The worst hospital you would ever see. Their staff are the most nonsense people. Even the doctors are not so good. They didn't listen to us properly and even their treatment style is worse than the district headquarters of Dhenkanal hospital. If you don't want your patient to have an early death surely never visit there. They only focus on how to get their bills before time. And in return about treatment they don't give a damn about it. If you have a lot of money you can simply just burn it with petrol instead of having a treatment there. They are the most horrible creatures on the planet.,SUM Hospital

3.7,"If you have insurance or want to do treatment through cash(specifically in patient treatment) I would strongly suggest to avoid Sum hospital. Once the patient is admitted you will feel like as if your close ones are getting treated in a government hospital (rural area). No proper communication at all about the patient /treatment, as an attendant you need to follow up for even getting an update, for getting a test done, for getting the results and even to shift from ICU to normal ward or for discharge. Such a big hospital and with lot of fame but there is nothing systemic. Department doctors won't be visiting ICU on a regular basis and after escalation they used to visit ICU to treat a critical patient. I don't doubt the ability of any doctor, but I beleive this hospital is getting used for the PG students as a case study/pratical perspective. In fact heard from the security guards that it would be better to get treated at Sum ultimate if you can afford. Sum hospital is only good and reliable only for the BSKY card holders. This is a genuine review and I have personally experienced the same here. This will be my first and last visit to Sum hospital and will strongly discourage my near and dear ones to avoid this hospital.",SUM Hospital
